# Dependent Rational Animals (1999).pdf

## Two important questions

In his book, *Dependent Rational Animals*, Alasdair McIntyre argues that in order to understand the importance of a moral understanding of the virtues in moral reasoning, we have to understand the metaphysical nature underlyning our humanity. According to McIntyre, at the hart of our nature lies a social dependence that exists in every person. Further, he argues that the reason that many moral philosophies are lacking, is that they do not acknowledge this interdependence that is at the heart of human experience. 

He begins by asking 'Why is it important for us to attend to and to understand what human beings have in common with members of other intelligent animal species?' and 'What makes attention to human vulnerability and disability important for moral philosophers?' As such, McIntyre appears to recognize that an understanding of human interdepence and by such, a recognition of human vulnerability as central to an adequate account of moral philosophy. "In After Virtue I had attempted to give an account of the place of the virtues, understood as Aristotle had understood them, within social practices, the lives of individuals and the lives of communities, while making that account independent of what I called Aristotle's' "metaphysical biology." As such, an account of human biology, is as important to a moral philosophy, as is an account of the moral virtues to an account of virtue ethics. "Although there is indeed good reason to repudiate important elements in Aristotle's biology, I now judge that I was in error in supposing an ethics independent of biology to be possible."

## Two reasons as to why biology is of central importance to moral philosophy

1. First, McIntyre argues that the importance of biology in a defensible moral philosophy will explain, or at least "point us to" an explanation of why or how we might suppose that human beings would be capable of any demands that a moral theory might place on us. "The first is that no account of the goods, rules and virtues that are definitive of our moral life can be adequate that does not explain---or at least point us towards an explanation---how that form of life is possible for beings who are biologically constituted as we are, by providing us with an account of our development towards and into that form of life." 
2. He further argues that a moral philosophy which has at its core, a theory about human biology,
3. 
4. A failure to understand that condition and the light thrown upon it by a comparison between humans and members of other intelligent animal species will obscure crucial features of that development. Therefore, a theory of ethics requires an account of biology. 1. An account of biology will explain how this theory of ethics is possible for biological (animal) beings like us. 2. Not being able to understand our biological conditions will obscure features crucial to the kind of moral development that we are concerned with. By understanding our biological natures, we development an understanding our our dependence on one another and from this vantage will have a greater respect for the importance of the virtues in our lives.
Not only was Aquinas not an Aristotelian, but he was a keen perceptive interpreter as well as adapter of Aristotle. Because of Aquinas's prayer that he has the humility to ask for things which we does not have from those who do, we can surmise that Aquinas does not share Aristotle's views of megalopsychos. As such, McIntyre argues that Aquinas's account corrects Aristotle's to a greater degree than previously realized.

'Why is it important for us to attend to and to understand what human beings have in common with members of other intelligent animal species?' and 'What makes attention to human vulnerability and disability important for moral philosophers?'

## Approach

"In After Virtue I had attempted to give an account of the place of the virtues, understood as Aristotle had understood them, within social practices, the lives of individuals and the lives of communities, while making that account independent of what I called Aristotle's "metaphysical biology." Although there is indeed good reason to repudiate important elements in Aristotle's biology, I now judge that I was in error in supposing an ethics independent of biology to be possible---and I am grateful to those critics who argued this case against me---and this for two distinct, but related reasons."

1. The first is that no account of the goods, rules and virtues that are definitive of our moral life can be adequate that does not explain---or at least point us towards an explanation---how that form of life is possible for beings who are biological constituted as we are, by providing us with an account of our development towards and into that form of life.

2. A failure to understand that condition and the light thrown upon it by a comparison between humans and members of other intelligent animal species will obscure crucial features of that development.

Therefore, a theory of ethics requires an account of biology. 

1. An account of biology will explain how this theory of ethics is possible for biological (animal) beings like us.

2. Not being able to understand our biological conditions will obscure features crucial to the kind of moral development that we are concerned with. 

By understanding our biological natures, we development an understanding our our dependence on one another and from this vantage will have a greater respect for the importance of the virtues in our lives.

## Aquinas's Account of Virtue as Distinct from Aristotles's

Not only was Aquinas not an Aristotelian, but he was a keen perceptive interpreter as well as adapter of Aristotle. Because of Aquinas's prayer that he has the humility to ask for things which we does not have from those who do, we can surmise that Aquinas does not share Aristotle's views of megalopsychos. As such, McIntyre argues that Aquinas's account corrects Aristotle's to a greater degree than previously realized.

### How does Aquinas's account correct Aristotles's?

#### To be human is to be vulnerable

##### Vulnerability and Human Experience

"We human beings are vulnerable...It is most often to others that we owe our survival, let alone flourishing..."

"These two related sets of facts, those concerning our vulnerabilities and afflictions and those concerning the extent of our dependence on particular others are so evidently of singular importance that it might seem that no account of the human condition whose authors hoped to achieve credibility could avoid giving them a central place."

However, "the history of Western moral philosophy suggests otherwise." 

##### Vulnerability and Moral Philosophy

Often, accounts of vulnerable humanity are presented as though the vulnerable where a separate class of individuals and often as the possible subjects of benevolence by moral agents who are "themselves presented as though they were continuously rational, healthy and untroubled.

##### How does vulnerability affect accounts of moral philosophy

How would moral philosophy look if we understood vulnerability and affliction as central facts about the human condition? (This is a very important question) An account of the virtues then, will have to first understand that humanity is the necessitation of each of us on the other.

##### Relationship between virtues and human vulnerability

"There is also another and perhaps more fundamental relationship between our animal condition and our vulnerabilities. It will be a central thesis of this book that the virtues that we need, if we are to develop from our initial animal condition into that of independent rational agents, and the virtues that we need, if we are to confront and respond to vulnerability and disability both in ourselves and in others, belong to one and the same set of virtues, the distinctive virtues of dependent rational animals, whose dependence, rationality and animality have to be understood in relationship to each other."

Two kinds of virtue sets:

1. Those which will enable to develop from our initial animal condition into independent rational agents.

2. Those we need if we are to confront and respond to vulnerability and disability both in ourselves and in others.

Both belong to the same set. These are the "distinctive" virtues of dependent rational animals, "whose dependence, rationality an danimality have to be understood in relationship to each other."

### What is the account of human biology that is presupposed in McIntyre's Account?

### What is the dependence relationship?

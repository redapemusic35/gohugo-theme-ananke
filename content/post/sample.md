## Function Argument

I think that a good way to formulate Aristotle's argument is the following:

1. Every activity seeks some good. (1)
2. Happiness is the most virtuous activity of the soul over the course of one's life. (10 and 12)
3. Therefore the most complete good for human kind is happiness. 

# Every activity is aimed at some good. 
 

"What is intrinsically worth pursuing is more complete than what is worth pursuing because of something else, that what is never choice-worthy because of something else is more complete than things that are both intrinsically choice-worthy and choice-worthy because of it, and that what is unconditionally complete, then, is what is always intrinsically choice-worthy and never choice-worthy because of something else."1097b

1. The end of every activity is some good.
2. Some goods have intrinsic value and some goods have extrinsic value.
3. Goods with intrinsic value are valuable in and of themselves.
4. Therefore goods that have intrinsic value are more valuable than goods with extrinsic value.
5. The most complete good then is the end of all action; not done for any other reason (from 3 and 4)


# Happiness is the most virtuous activity of the soul over the course of one's life. 
For us, as human beings, this final good is happiness. Happiness is not sought for the sake of any other goods. Therefore happiness is intrinsically worth pursuing and as such is the most complete good.

"Happiness seems to be most like this, since it we always choose because of itself and never because of something else."1097b1 

Reeves interprets Aristotle as saying that an object's function is the "use or actualization of a state, capacity, or disposition".[@reev14a, p. 217] As such, each thing has a function which is to actualize whatever is distinctive about that thing. What is distinctive about that thing is that thing's function. "A function (ergon) is the activity that is the use or actualization of a state, capacity, or disposition, or it is a work or product that is the further resulty of such an activity."[@reev14a, p. 217]

6. A soul is the actualization of a particular state or capacity.
7. Function is the use or actualization of some state or capacity.
8. One could be alive in the sense of nutrition and one could be alive in the sense of activity. (6 and 7)

9. The function of a thing is that which is distinctive of its species. (7,8)
10. It is distinctive of human beings to live in accordance with reason. (5,9)

# The most complete good for human kind is happiness.

Not only is it to live in a way that is distinctive of it as a class of thing, but it is live this way well. "if all this is so, and a human being's function is supposed to be a sort of living, and this living is supposed to be activity of the soul and actions that involve reason, and it is characteristic of an excellent man to do these well and nobly."1098a13 Virtue is habituated by activity. The particular activity which is habituated however is that activity that is the function of a thing. The virtue of humans then is to habituate reasoning well, by continually using their capacity to reason.

11. Human function is an activity of the soul in accordance with reason. (from 9,10)
12. Character is habituated over the course of one's life. (11)
13. Excellent human function is excellent activity of the soul in accordance with reason. (12)

In order to determine what the function a human being has, is, we must determine what is unique to the human being that is not shared with any other things. For instance, human beings are a part of the totality of objects that has life. So it could be the case that a human being's function is to have life. However, humans also share this with plants. Therefore living cannot be the sole function of a human being given that it is not something unique to human beings.

Someone might question why something's function has to be what is unique to that thing. In the more specific case, a particular person might share the feature of being an excellent mason with other excellent masons. A contractor seeking someone to complete her design, is not only going to seek the one mason given his special and unique talents, but she is going to seek a team of masons all possessing the same unique talents. In this way it does not seem that the talents of those masons are particularly unique in contrast with one another.

However, Aristotle's argument is not that something's function is whatever is particularly unique to that thing in particular, but whatever is special and distinguishes that class of thing from other classes of things. A mason belongs to the class of masons, and this is to be distinguished from other classes such as the class of architects. Therefore, when attempting to determine the function of human beings, we are not looking at one individual human being, but what is special about human beings more generally in contrast to classes of things that are not human beings.

#### Overview

P1: The source of motivation is the presence of a relevant desire and means-end belief. This claim however, is widely rejected by Non-Humeans.  There is a second but related claim of which non-Humeans are divided in their rejection of:  P2: That motivation *requires* the presence of relevant desire and means-end belief.  One justification for This claim is that desires and means-end beliefs must be present whenever there is motivation but that they are not themselves the source of the motivation. 

1. Non-Humeans widely reject:
	1. Strong Claim: *R* at *t* constitutes a motivating reason of agent *A* to to $\phi$ iff there is some $\psi$ such that *R* at *t* consists of a desire of *A* to $\psi$ and a belief that were he to $\phi$, he would $\psi$.
2. However, Non-Humeans are divided in their acceptance/rejection of P3:
	1. Weak-Claim: Agent *A* at *t* has a motivating reason to $\phi$ only if there is some $\psi$ such that, at *t*, *A* desires to $\psi$ and believes that were he to $\phi$, he would $\psi$.

While some philosophers accept P2, others reject P2. One claim is that P2 'is phenomenlogically false, or vacuous.' Smith however argues that because he does not believe P1 to be false, he has no reason to also reject P2. He gives three reasons why Non-Humeans who reject P1 are missing a very important point about the nature of truth regarding motivating reasons. He argues that...

1. They fail to distinguish motivating reasons from other sorts of reasons
2. They have an inadequate conception of desire
3. They overlook the fact that reasons explanations are teleological

##### Distinction between normative reasons and motivation reasons

When we say that someone has a reason to $\phi$, it is ambiguous just what sort of reason it is. It could be a normative reason, or it could be motivating. If I were to stand on someone's foot, I might have a reason to get off, but this reason does not necessarily have to be motivating. To say that someone has a *motivating* reason is to say that the agent is in a *potentially explanatory state*. Further, this state does not need to be fully explanatory because it might provide just enough justification for the agent but not necessarily for an interested third party viewing the agent's actions. 

However, the agent could also have a normative reason. Normative reasons speak to various normative requirements that the agent must adhere to. Finally, the agent may have a normative reason to perform an action of which he has no motivating reason to do, and the agent may have a motivating reason to perform an action of which he has no normative reason towards.

##### Objection: Nagel

One possible problem for Humeans, is to explain how future desires motivate present actions, which would require present actions. The initial explanation given by Hume is that "Agents who are motivated by prudential considerations each have a quite general present desire to further their future interests." Nagel gives two objections:

1. The system does not allow for the expectation of future reasons to provide reasons for current actions
2. Present desires for future actions do allow for present actions in pursuit of future objects

Smith does not think any of the above objections work. The first fails because even if the expectation of a future reason did provide reasons for current action, it would not have been irrational for it to do so. Irrationality would arise only in the instance that an agent has a normative reason. But Hume only speaks to motivating, not normative reasons.

##### Objection: McDowell

According to Smith, McDowell (though he admits that he does not quite understand McDowell's point) understands that Humeans have a causal conception of reasons explanation. McDowell however thinks that causal conceptions of reasons explanations are misconception. In order to see why this is false, Smith begins to state how casual conceptions might be said to support Humean theory.

1. Causal conceptions are said to be p states with causal force.
2. Desires are the only psychological states with causal force

However, Smith thinks that we can think of other psychological states as have causal force, such as beliefs. But an agent's actions could be caused by something with a teleological or reasoned force behind it. However, nothing needs to be said about the nature of the reason. Therefore the reason might or might not have causal force.

1. There are two theories about desires which Smith considers:
	1. Strong - Desires are sensations:
		1. It is possible that a subject is mistaken about their desires unlike sensations which are difficult to dispute.
		2. Therefore it is wrong that causal conceptions are p states with causal force
		3. Further, if desires are like states, then they would have propositional content.
		4. However, if this were the case, then they would be like sentences:
			1. *A* desires that *p*
			2. *A* pains that *p*
		5. But this does not hold
	2. Weak - Desires are *like* sensations:
		1. Do not contribute to our understanding of what a state with a propositional content is like:
			1. e.g., *A* desires that *p*
			2. *A* pains that *p*
		2. But lastly, we do not believe that desires are states with propositional content
		3. But desires are dispositional states with propositional content.

:Davidson and Action: What are the necessary questions when determining agency?
 :Who an dwhy question: There is a special sense of why,

Intention, intentional action, action

Desire is a state with a certain functional role. 

:Disposition: An account of what a desire is that explains how it is that desires have propositional content. This is because the propositional content of a desire might be determined by its functional role. 

Question: 

Could you know what your desires are?

:Yes, but also no. It is not clear what would suppress desires such that you would not know that you have them. Desires are states which you are dispositioned to desire $\phi$. Desire has to be the right shape to explain action, and state is supposed to help facilitate?

:Desire is a dispositional state:

But this is problematic because you could have a desire for some non-existent content. For instance, you might desire the extension of the Martian race though you do not believe and it is not true that martians exist.

:Direction of fit:
Belief is mind to world while desire is world to mind.

:Pro Attitude: Desire

The functional role of the mental state with the direction of fit, for desire, is that it is meant to bring the world into accord with the content of the desire. 

Beliefs are supposed to go out of existence if the world does not fit with the contents of said belief.

##### Argument for Humeanism

1. Having a motivating reason is *inter-alia* having to have a goal.
2. Having a goal is being in a state with which the world must fit.
3. Being in this state is desiring.

#### Anscombe on Intention

What sort of practical reasoning are people referencing in intention?

:Traditional View of Action: 

:Standard vew of Action:

1. What kind of theory of action is this?:
	1. belief and desire:
		1. desires are point of motivation
		2. belief involves practical reasoning
	2. Something of human action standard story does not explain:
		1. Animals do things which seem similar to 1.
		2. But not in the right way.
2. Some Questions:
	1. :Accordian Account: Focus is in the varying descriptions of some actions:
		1. the same event is comprised of different actions:
			1. Killing the king with poison in the ear
			2. evil corporation (told in class)
			3.

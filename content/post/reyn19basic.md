# Abstract 

On a traditional virtue theoretic account of knowledge, knowledge is a competence to believe truly. In "Competence to Know", Lisa Miracchi argues against a traditional virtue epistemologies on the basis that knowledge is more fundamentally basic than belief. [@mira15ctka] On her account, knowledge is a competence to know. I will argue that one who accepts her account will have more reason to attribute knowledge on the basis of the religious experiences of individuals.


# Introduction

Internalists in general epistemology often argue that those factors which
differentiate knowledge from merely true belief are entirely internal to the
believing agent [@alst86a]. However, many epistemologists no longer accept
internalism. Those who do not accept internalism would argue that not only are
 internal factors important for knowledge attribution, but there are
external factors which are salient as well [@plan88pesa; @grec14kaua].[^1]

[^1]: By *knowledge-attribution*, I mean ascribing knowledge to someone's belief.
It is a way of saying that someone *knows*. I adopt the usage from John Greco's *Achieving Knowledge* [@grec10akva]. Knowledge, is used in a terminological manner as a way of ascribing the mark of achievement to some particular individual.

One particularly important factor in knowledge attribution for externalists is perception. In
cases of perception, an externalist would say that the object of perception
amounts to knowledge for the person who is perceiving the object. General
epistemologists generally theorize about general knowledge. Religious
epistemologists generally theorize about religious knowledge, a subset of
general knowledge. Following the aforementioned externalist trend in general
epistemology, many religious epistemologists have begun to argue that
externalism justifies attributing knowledge in cases of religious experiences
as a kind of perception [@grec17a;@alst86a].

However, you might be wondering why we might think that
the basis of perception gives one a reason to attribute knowledge to the person
doing the perceiving. One reason that we might think so, is that the cognitive
faculties which are responsible for the perception, are designed to operate for
this specific purpose. Analogously then, in cases of religious experience as a kind of
perception, it would follow that there is something specific about the agent
wherein there must be some kind of faculty, cognitive or otherwise, which when
operating the way that it should, would produce something like a perception for
the religious agent. 

In that case, the perception equates to a religious experience. As such, one
holding the view that religious experiences as perceptions cannot be compared
with more general experiences as perceptions, would have to specify how
religious experiences as perception are not like general experiences as perception.

As such, I think that it would be fair to say that externalist accounts in
religious epistemology are motivated by similar considerations as those in general epistemology. Possible salient factors are those that are external to the agent as well as internal. Some important considerations for knowledge attribution in cases of religious belief then are those which justify the attribution of knowledge in general cases of belief.

In section 1.1, I will first explain the motivation for externalism in religious
epistemology, and then in section 1.2,  show how the virtue account of knowledge is the
intuitive consequence of the externalist move in general epistemology. In
section 1.3, I will explain how Alvin Plantinga's *proper-function* argument and William Alston's *perception-of-God* argument cohere with the traditional virtue theoretical account of knowledge, hereafter referred to as IDE.

In section 2, I present Miracchi's properly basic account of knowledge. In
section 2.1, I will then develop this account by expressing concerns with IDE considered by some Miracchi. In section 2.2, I then defend virtue epistemology against these objections using the Direct Virtue Epistemology approach developed by Miracchi.

In section 3, I will argue that someone who accepts Miracchi's DVE will have to accept the justification of religious beliefs given DVE's justification of more general beliefs. In section 5, I conclude by voicing potential concerns arising from a DV in religious epistemology (DVRE).

# Section 1 Externalism in Religious Epistemology

On externalist accounts of knowledge, knowledge is attributed given factors
which are not just internal to the individual whom knowledge is attributed to,
but external as well. Virtue epistemologists who are externalists, argue that
the epistemic properties of knowledge can be explained in terms of the
epistemic properties of persons [@grec12d]. For virtue epistemologists, such
epistemic properties might include things like cognitive faculties. Given
the fact that an agent only had *some* control over what cognitive faculties she
has, these are often thought of as external to the agent.

## Section 1.1 Externalism and Virtue Epistemology

As such, externalists would argue that the factors salient in knowledge attribution are
varied. On virtue theories of knowledge for instance, knowledge is attributed
given the epistemic competences of the agent. However, as we we will see, these
competences are not singularly important.

For some epistemologists, belief is similar to action. Further, action is a
kind of performance. When we evaluate an agent performing some particular
action, care is taken to ensure that the agent does deserve credit for the
performance of that action. An agent does deserve credit if and only if credit
for that action cannot be given to someone else, or attributed in any way to
some other factor, such as luck.

According to virtue epistemologists, we attribute knowledge as an
accomplishment in the same way that we attribute the performance of an action
as a kind of competence. The fact that the activities of the agent are
responsible for the accomplishment in question is a reason to attribute
competence to that agent. In the same way, we also attribute knowledge.  The activities and competences of the agent are important because we want to know that the
accomplishment, obtaining knowledge or performing action, was done in such a way as to preclude lucky occurrences of that accomplishment.

### Consider the following case:

> When a man takes there to be a sheep in the field and does so under conditions which are such that, when a man does thus take there to be a sheep in the field, then it is evident to him that there is a sheep in the field. The man, however, has mistaken a dog for a sheep and so what he sees is not a sheep at all. Nevertheless, unsuspected by the man, there is a sheep in another part of the field. [@chis89a]

In this case, though the agent does hold a true belief 'that there is a sheep
in the field', his belief is not a manifestation of his intellectual
competence. Therefore, in this case, the belief was not achieved in the right
way. This is because the agent does not believe 'because' of an intellectual
ability but rather was lucky [@grec10a, p. 75].

## Section 1.2

While the above case might account for a wide range of Gettier cases, it will
not account for all Gettier cases. As externalists have shown, there are many
possible sources of knowledge. Therefore, considerations of the agent's
competence are not sufficient to ground attributions of knowledge. In the above
case, the agent's true belief was not a manifestation of his intellectual
ability. But what about cases where the agent's true belief *is* a manifestation of his true belief and yet the agent still does not *know*?

consider...

> Henry is driving in the countryside and sees a barn ahead in clear view. On
this basis he believes that the object he sees is a barn. Unknown to Henry
however, the area is dotted with barn facades that are indistinguishable from
real barns from the road. However, Henry happens to be looking at the one real
barn in the area [@grec10a, p. 76].

Here, even though Henry's belief *is* a manifestation of his intellectual
ability, he could just as easily have been wrong about his belief. This is
because there is no reason for us to suspect that Henry's intellectual capacities are suitable for his current environment in the current context.

Therefore, a sufficient virtue account will other factors in addition
to that of the agent's comptence. The first, shown above, (a) is its context sensitivity. What we care about, is whether the agent's epistemic faculties are suited to function in the given environment.

The second consideration that we make is the motive the one attributing has in
attributing knowledge to the knower. We care about whether the knowledge is
important to the individual giving the attribution. This will be true if it can
be said that the attributed is a good source of information for the
one attributing knowledge in the case considered.

Consider the following case where  we are looking for good sources of home-runs
and not information. [^2]

[^2]: Adopted from [@grec10a]

> Sammy Sosa is really good at hitting home-runs during a baseball game. However, Mr. Sosa is probably not so good at hitting home-runs in a war. As such, Sammy's competence is an explanatorily salient factor in his ability to hit home-runs during a baseball game. But I would not expect it to be an explanatorily salient factor in hitting home-runs during a war. Although it is perfectly conceivable that Mr. Sosa might hit a homerun or two during a war, we might not attribute his ability to do so to competence. I would not sign Mr. Sosa to my fantasy baseball roster because of his ability to hit home-runs during a war, but because of his ability to do so during a baseball game.

As we saw, knowledge attribution is context sensitive, meaning that it takes into account conditions (shifting circumstances within an environment) and the environment (sets of relatively stable circumstances) in which the belief is held. A knowing agent then, "believes the truth because [the agent] believes from intellectual ability."[@grec12e, p. 101] Lastly, attribution takes into consideration the motivations of the attributor.

## Section 1.3 IVE and Religious Epistemology

As shown in the previous subsection, when we attribute knowledge to individuals, we not only care about the item known, but we also care about the way in which the item came to be known. We care about the individual who knows, the environment in which the individual came to know, and the cognitive faculties which are involved in the individual's knowing. We also care about the intents and purposes of the one attributing knowledge in a particular case.

For an analogous treatment in religious epistemology, we will look at Alvin Plantinga's Proper Function Argument and William Alston's Perception of God.

### Section 1.3.1 William Alston's Defence of Basic Religious Perception

In "Perceiving God", Alston argues that the perception of God, with respect to
religious belief, plays a role similar to that played by sense perception, with
respect to general beliefs [@alst86a]. Further, these perceptual experiences can justify an agent's belief, which in turn translates the agent's belief into knowledge for that agent. When attempting to explain Mr. Sosa's competence at hitting home-runs, we point not only to his environment, the baseball game, but also to unique faculties that he might possess. We care about the keeness of his eyesight, the operations of his motor cortex etc.

Human beings engage in a number of basic doxastic practices. For Alston, what qualifies an agent's practices as basically doxastic, is that "each of these involve a distinctive sort of input to belief-forming" mechanisms. Each practice has its own range of contents and set of functions that determine the belief contents as a "function of input features."

On this treatment, we can classify a religious belief as arising when
there is a distinctive range of contents (subject matter and ways of conceiving
it), a set of functions that determine belief contents as a function of input
features; and experiential practices which are (a) socially established, (b)
socially shared, (c) inculcated, (d) reinforced and (e) propagated.[^3]

[^3]: Many of the features in Alston's treatment above involve communities in which knowledge is shared. These features are also present in general knowledge attribution as shown in the Sosa case above. As such, there is a question in general epistemology which concerns questions about knowledge in a communal context. However, in this paper I will not have the appropriate space to explain knowledge further in this context.

### Subsection 1.3.2 Plantinga's Proper Function

Epistemologists have often argued that knowledge entails that a belief is true; and that it has some other special factor associated with it to rule out occurences of luck. In many virtue theories, this other factor is justification. For instance, on IVEs, the competence of the agent is what justifies the beliefs of the agent.

Alvin Plantinga has famously offered a proper functionalist account of
knowledge, PFK, wherein he offers warrant as the factor which is appended onto
true belief. According to Plantinga, a true belief is warranted when the
following four considerations can be said to be true of the belief in question. Plantinga's account is cognate to general virtue theories about knowledge.

#### PFK

1. S knows p only if

2. *p* is true,

3. S's belief is the result of properly functioning cognitive faculties, (c) S's faculties are operating in an appropriate environment, and

4. when functioning properly in an appropriate environment, S's faculties reliably produce true beliefs rather than false beliefs.

How might we know that our cognitive capacities are functioning properly? Even assuming that our knowledge is to be explained in terms of reliable doxastic practices, what makes us think that these practices are reliable unless we already know that our cognitive faculties are functioning properly, assuming that you cannot show that you know?

The fact is that someone who proposes that we need to answer this question in regards to religious beliefs but not general ones is setting a double standard. Further, this objection does not show that we do not have knowledge of the world, because as we have seen, we regularly attribute knowledge to persons based on perceptual and other cognitive faculties. Therefore, the response given by religious epistemologists such as Plantinga and Alston hold that explanations of religious belief tend to focus on the intuitions that we do not require similar type accounts for basic and perceptual knowledge.

Neither should we expect to do so on the assumption that God exists. There is a difference between understanding and knowledge. When someone asks us to explain our beliefs, they are asking to help understand those beliefs. But understanding is not needed for knowledge.

## Section 2 - The Miracchi's Problem with IVE

Lisa Zagebski argues that to create a Gettier style counter example, we first need to establish anaccident involving otherwise reliable faculties which become unreliableas a result of this accident. Further, we need to entail some furtherconsequent situation wherein by some further disconnected accident, theagent hits on the truth anyway.[@zagz96a]

## Section 2.1

> Consider Josh, a 1st century pagan in France. After a freak accidentinvolving
a herd of pigs, Josh (who is extremely precocious) develops a series of phobias which manifest as a highly restrictive set of dietary and sanitary habits.
Luckily for Josh, when his village contracts plague, Josh is spared on account of his unique dietary and sanitary habits. Mary, an unrepentant pagan servant girl from the neighboring convent, sees Josh feverishly washing his hands one dayand mistakenly thinks that Josh is praying and repenting of his sins. Previously unconvinced by the nun's repeated attempts to convert her, Mary attributes Josh's luck in avoiding the plague (she knows that everyone in his village died) to God's providence on account of hermisperception of Josh. She subsequently forms the belief that God exists.

Mary has been Gettiered. This is because her otherwise reliable cognitive faculties (her sensus divinitatis) are not reliable for her. Further, we can attribute this case of bad luck to an accident. It is anaccident that Josh developed the life saving habits that he did. Further, it is an accident that she thinks Josh is repenting of his sins, he's as much of a pagan as he has ever been. If Plantinga is correct, then God would have created Mary's cogntive faculties in such away as to produce true beliefs for her. Her sensus divinitatis then would also have been created in such a way as to produce true beliefs for Mary. However, in this case, what would have triggered a truereligious belief, the witnessing of a miracle, produces an unreliablebelief, 'Josh believes in God'. However, Mary, because of luck, formsthe true belief that "God exists". That is what has happened in thiscase. It is unlucky for Mary that she is unable to form the true beliefgiven the effort of the nuns in her convent, however it is a case ofgood luck that witnessing and misunderstanding Josh's actions, she formsthe correct true belief anyway.

There are two options available for someone defending a view of religious knowledge. Given indirect virtue epistemology, 'knowledge is an achievement which is explained by a knower's competence to believe truly'@greco201However, under this view, knowledge can still be attributed to a case of bad luck.

## Section 2.3 - Bad Luck

Indirect virtue epistemology, with regard to Gettier cases, will always fail. Theories which place the object of performance on somethingshort of knowledge, will fail to explain the way in which knowledge is an achievement of that performance. IDE fails because indirect virtue epistemology defines knowledge as an achievement that isexplained by the knower's competence to do something other than know. Therefore, this account is belief-first because it articulates knowledge in terms of true belief. As such, knowledge is not characteristic of competencesthat explain knowledge.

Miracchi then gives a procedure which is supposed to show why the indirect view will always fail in response to Gettier problems. She argues that one starts with a Gettier case. Specify some additional fact as separate from whatever fact it is that justifies the belief. What Miracchi's counter example adds is some additional feature such that when the agent encounters that which justifies the belief, and a bit of bad luck such that the belief is not knowledge, she will encounter some good luck such that her true belief is a result of a characteristic manifestation of her competence. Yet the subject still does not have knowledge.

Miracchi's own virtue epistemology however, explains knowledge in terms of knowledge. While this might initially sound circular, it is not because knowledge and basic justification are thought of as justifying belief. The relationship between belief and knowledge then is a disjunctive one. If one disjunct turns out false, then the belief would not be justified. Yet the agent still possesses knowledge.

# Section 3

So what explains

## Section 3.1 Explain DVE given RE

### A general procedure

#### Direct virtue epistemology

Knowledge is an exercise of a competence to know. Because of this, knowledge as
an achievement is explained by the knower's competence, cannot be anything less
than competence to know rather than to merely believe. Further, she imposes a proficiency condition wherein the probability that the characteristic manifestation of knowledge will be sufficiently high. What these conditions of knowledge do, she argues, is not leave any room for a success condition that would be distinct from the achievement condition. As such, she argues that there is no room for a Gettier style counterexample.

She then argues that merely justified beliefs occur in conditions which deviate
from the conditions constitutive of knowledge. Miracchi makes a distinction between two types of justification. She argues that justified belief is a "disjunctive kind" whose disjuncts are knowledge and mere justified belief. But our belief does not have to be justified by her other sense of justification, and yet we still argue that an agent has knowledge given that knowledge as a mental state prior to that of justification and belief.

So if one's belief is knowledge because of the successful competence to know, and the same belief is justified given the successful exercise of a competence to believe, then the belief is justified. But if we cannot say that a belief is justified because we do not understand how the necessary faculty works, well so much for justification in Miracchi's other sense. But this does not harm our theory of knowledge at all since knowledge is foundational.

Lastly, Miracchi argues that DVE accomplishes two central tasks. It explains what it is for knowledge to be a mental state in its own right and it explains what justification is and its relationship to knowledge.

In Miracchi's direct view, justification, $J_{n}$ is a disjunctive kind "whose disjuncts are knowledge and a state metaphysically dependent on knowledge, and so is entirely metaphysically dependent on knowledge."

#### DVI Justification

Mere Justification = $J_{m}$ occurs when an agent has degenerately exercised
her competence to know $C_{k}$. Mere Justification, $J_{m}$ = degenerate
exercise of $C_{k}$ $(C_{k} ightarrow K)$ $(K ee J_{m}) ightarrow J_{n}$. In Miracchi's account, knowledge is more fundamentally basic than justification. Further, justification for a belief requires knowledge while mere justification does not require knowledge as such but still has an explanatorily salient role in an account of knowledge which relies on justified belief.

#### Justification

It is plausible that $J_{n}$ is possible without knowledge since it is merely a degenerate exercise of $C_{k}$ while $J_{n}$, is derivative of a situation wherein an agent has knowledge and mere justification.

Therefore, $(K \land J_{m})$ = $J_{n}$

# Conclusion

Some additional areas of possible research might be the connection between the objects of general epistemic faculties and of religious epistemic faculties.

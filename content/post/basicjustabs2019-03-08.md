# abstract 

On a traditional virtue theoretic account of knowledge, knowledge is a competence to believe truly. In "Competence to Know", Lisa Miracchi [@mira15a] argues against a traditional virtue epistemologies on the basis that knowledge is more fundamentally basic than belief. On her account, knowledge is a competence to know. I will argue that one who accepts her account will have reason to attribute knowledge on the basis of the religious experiences of individuals.


On externalist accounts of knowledge, knowledge is attributed given factors which are not just internal to the individual whom knowledge is attributed to, but external as well. Virtue epistemologists who are externalists, argue that the epistemic properties of knowledge can be explained in terms of the epistemic properties of persons [@grec12vea]. For virtue epistemologists, such epistemic properties might include things like cognitive faculties and function. These functions support foundational states of knowing for knowing agents.

In what follows, I  present Miracchi's properly basic account of knowledge on which knowledge is more basic than belief. Beginning with her criticism of indirect virtue epistemology (IVE), I will defend her account before going on to argue that someone who accepts her account, will have reason to accept the religious beliefs of religious individuals as justified given their relationship to the foundational mental states of the believing agent.

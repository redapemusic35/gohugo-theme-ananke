### What is Justice?

1. To give to each what is owed him.:
  1. Cannot give something to someone who is irrational what will ultimately harm them.
2. Maybe what we mean to say is that we give to friends what friends deserve and to enemies what enemies deserve.:
  1. Friends deserve benefits and enemies deserve harm.:
    1. Who is most capable of treating friends well and enemies poorly?:
      1. It depends on the circumstance:
	1. at sea, a ship captain
	2. therefore the best time to benefit fiends and harm enemies is during war
      2. But then, the best time to cause harm or do good is:
	1. in illness
	2. in war
	3. at sea
      3. Further, there is a positive and negative sense of justice:
	1. Positive sense, justice is useless
	2. Negative sense is problematic because it infers that a just person can make people unjust which is not true.
3. Whatever is to the advantage of the stronger:
  1. 




## 2019-02-14

Today, we are going to look at ways of making arguments better. There are a
number of ways to do this, but there are three ways that I would like for us to
focus on today. These include:

1. Looking at a paper line by line.
2. Try to understand which lines are supporting which.
3. Summarize each into as few as we can.

# In practice

So how do we do this in practice? When we have an argument before us, given the
desired outcome of this course, what we want to do is articulate that argument
in the most clear, and concise way possible. 

## The Argument

Socrates has just been condemmed to death. Typically, as he argues, whenever he
is about to do something which might cause harm to him, his powers of prophecy
prevent him from doing so. However, this time, he received no such guidance.

Given this outcome, he takes it as a good thing that we was prevented in this
way. What is the argument for how this might be the case? In other words, why
should we think that this is a good thing that Socrates has been condemmed to
die?

### Valid Argument Forms

We are going to attempt to recreate Socrates' argument using the method from
valid argument forms that was given in your handout on blackboard.

Consider the following: Let us reflect in this way, too, that there is good
hope that death is a blessing and that those who believe death to be an evil
are mistaken:

1. for it is one of two things: either the dead are nothing and have no perception of anything or it is, as we are told, a change and a relocating for the soul form here to another place.

2. If it is complete lack of perception, like a dreamless sleep, then death would be a great advantage.

   1. If death is like this I say it is an advantage, for all eternity would then seem to be no more than a single night.

3. If, on the other hand, death is a change from here to another place, and what we are told is true and all who have died are there, what greater blessing could there be, gentlemen of the jury?
   1. The Greek Heroes reside in Hates.
   2. They would allow me to spend my time in inquiry.

4. Either death is a great advantage, or death is a blessing.
5. Therefore death is not an evil.

1. Either A $\vee$ B
2. A $\rightarrow$ C
3. B $\rightarrow$ D
4. C $\vee$ D
 
### Is Gene Therapy an Unqualified Good?

At this point, not everyone agrees that even preventing genetic disease through
germline gene therapy is an unqualified good. The ability to insert functioning
genes into embryos where their absence would lead to disabling disorders seems,
on the face of it, to be a good thing, a benefit, a gift to the child who would
otherwise be disabled. But, as ethicists have pointed out, germline gene
therapy on embryos does not just prevent genetic disorders, or cure disease, or
control symptoms—all valid goals of medicine. Rather, it prevents an individual
with a given genotype from coming into being. Germline gene therapy, some
claim, is thus a judgment on what genotypes deserve to exist—what kind of
people are wanted and what kind of people are unwanted. Advocates for those
with disabilities protest that germline gene therapy sends a harmful message:
people with disabilities are less valued than people without disabilities.
Germline gene therapy, these opponents say, is no different from aborting
fetuses with inherited disorders and selecting or rejecting embryos on the
basis of their genetic make-up. None of the 3 practices is a gift; all are
eugenic harms against those with disabilities.

1. A or $\neg A$ (Either is an unqualified good, or it is not an unqualified
   good)

2. A $\rightarrow$ B (If it is an unqualified good, then it is a good thing)
3. $\neg$ B
4. $\neg$ A

### Argument Evaluation

[CV](cv/post/new.md)

What we are beginning to do today is probably one of the most central and important aspects of philosophical study. Until now, we have merely made arguments the way we probably always have. We have thought of reasons that until now, how sounded good and fine to us, and then we have defended those reasons based on other more additional reasons that have sounded good and fine to us. Sometimes the person with the most reasons wins the argument. Sometimes the person or persons with the most good and fine reasons wins the argument. And sometimes the person or persons with the most reasons that sound good and fine to us is the person who wins the argument. 

However, we have probably never really thought about why someone's reasons, or our own for that matter, have sounded good and fine to us. Previously, and maybe you have done this and maybe you haven't, but the argument used to be that; the reason why an argument sounds good and fine to you is because it is one that your parents taught you, neighbor, grand parents, pastor, teacher etc. Consider religious arguments:

1. Talk about office hours:
	1. Office hours will be on Tuesdays between 8am and 10am and by appointment
	2. I will be meeting students in the first floor common area of Adorjan hall
	3. I suggest that when writing your papers, if you have any questions about some area of the argument use the office hours.
	4. If for any reason you are not able to make my office hours, then please do not hesitate to email me. I am almost always in Adorjan so I can meet you whenever you need. But please try to make use of the office hours.

== Introduction ==


== Summary ==

Last week, we talked of whether our use of the death penalty is justified practice. 
* Concerns presented include:
	* Its effectiveness
	   * For instance, does the possibility for death deter crimes?
	*  A correlative use for the death penalty as was mentioned, includes the indefinite protection of America's citizens from harm by any means necessary. It was said, "some individuals are not fit for life in a modern society".
* What I should have done, is list in descending order, our reasons for and against our use of the death penalty.

				=== Arguments  ===

* Now that we have had some time to think about it, let's go ahead and list our reasons on the board:
	* We will start with reasons why we should not have a death penalty.

* List reasons on the board.

== About our Reasons ==

1. What is the common characteristic of all things pious? Whether word, deed, attitude, behavior, trait.
2. Looking at our reasons then, what we want to know is whether or not there is some principle which when applied to other questions, we will be able to determine the correct answer.
3. So let's look at the first reason, and then try to build a principle which when applied to other questions, say abortion, we might be able to determine the most logical position that we should take.

=== The Study of Philosophy ===

* Some in class on wednesday felt a little bit dismayed at the way Socrates pressed Euthyphro:
	* Maybe it felt like Socrates was being disingenuous, that Socrates was pretending to know less about the nature of piety than he was letting on. Why would someone feel that this was true:
* What do we feel about hoarders? Do we  pity them? Having to live with all of that clutter.
	* What do we feel about people who have a lot of goods? This one is a bit of a mixed bag. We typically want to argue that they deserve what they worked for, they deserve the fruits of their labor and so on.
	* I cannot see any reason why I would disagree. If someone worked really hard and well and they have the results to show for it, why shouldn't they experience the benefits of their hard labor.
	* We don't expect them to have to share what they've earned.

*  If then we think that Socrates is being disingenious, it is not because we think that there is something that he knows, but is keeping from us. Or is it?:
	* Just like our possessions, if we worked hard to obtain something, than what responsibility do we have to share what we have obtained?
	* Shouldn't this work in the same respects for knowledge?:
		* Why do people donate to charity?
		* Why do the wealthy, those who do, set up charitable organizations?
		* Why do we share what we know with those who do not know?




=== Formal Arguments ===
We made arguments. There are two different definitions for argument.

1. an exchange of diverging or opposite views, typically a heated or angry one: I've had an argument with my father | heated arguments over public spending | there was some argument about the decision. 
2. a reason or set of reasons given with the aim of persuading others that an action or idea is right or wrong: there is a strong argument for submitting a formal appeal | [with clause] : he rejected the argument that keeping the facility would be costly.

In this class, we will mostly be concerned with the second form. As I mentioned last week, in this class, we are a group. We have been united by forces beyond our control and for this reason we ought to make the best of it.

The way that we do this is by improving ourselves. But given the sort of things that we are, it just so happens that we improve in the contexts of a community. 

=== Parts of an Argument ===

An argument is a reason or a set of reasons.

1. So first, what we are going to do is start with a clarification of our points of discussion.
      1. What are the view points?
      2. What are the reasons why we think a particular view is the correct one?

:Euthyphro: What is :piety: ? 

Some initial observations:
* :Euthyphro: is a priest, however it is not established whether or not he became a priest prior to trying his father in court.
* He is trying his father for murder.
* A worker in a drunken rage murdered a servant. Euthyphro's father placed the guilty worker, bound, into a ditch while he went to determine what were his religious obligations towards the worker. 
  However, assuming that the condemned worker would be put to death anyway, he did not take proper precautions to ensure the saftey of the condemned.
  
  * Why should it be important whether or not Euthyphro is a priest?
  * It is possible that the only reason why Euthyphro is trying his father is because he wants to rid his own, via his family's, guilt.
  * This means that his motivations are not truly virtuous.
=== Some important points ===
	1. What is :piety: ?
	2. Are :pious: actions :pious: because the gods love them or do the gods love :pious: actions beacuse they are :pious: ?

=== The Arguments ===

1. Euthyphro should prosecute is father.
 1. What are some reasons given for why Euthyphro should?
2. Should not prosecute:
	1. this comes in the form of considerations:
		1. Euthyphro is acting impiously towards his father.
		2. Would have to know what is pious in order to take such a risk.

In an athens court, it was a very risky business to bring a criminal charge against someone.

1. Euthyphro knows pious from impious actions.
2. One who knows is under obligation to act.
3. Therefore Euthyphro is obligated to bring a trial against his father.

== What is Piety? ==

[[file:~/Desktop/OneDrive - Saint Louis University/intro/definepiety.pdf|file:~ Desktop OneDrive   Saint Louis University intro definepiety pdf]] 

1. What is Piety?
    1. Piety is doing what I’m doing - prosecuting anyone guilty of murder, even one’s father. (Didn’t Zeus do just the same?)
    2. But this is an explanation.
    3.

* What kinds of goods? Instrumental

Ethics is a form of political science, deals with a population rather than an individual. Aristotle's intended reader excels in all other areas, including military, athelics etc.

Everything is a preparation to do politics. This is simi redundant in that Aristotle's intended audience is proficient at each of Aristotle's criteria.

Want's to know what things destroy or facilitate a best city. 

* What is the best institutional structore for a person.

There are some aspects of human nature that are susceptible to reason and others that are not. Automatic responses for instance.

:techne: Latin translates this as art but this is not suitable

Further, one might think of this as crafts, but once again this is not a good translation either. 

:techne: involves making, thinking, acting. "KNOWING" how to make something. The goal is some good.

* Practical
* Theoretical
* Productive

Aristotle's questions regarding ethics are similarly related to questions of metaphysics. Not sure exactly how however.
=== Primary Question ===

What is good for humans, for me?
==== Kinds of Activity ====

* Is a kind of activity

:poesis: making, producing, knowing how :peosis: kind of knowing is :techne:

:theoria: the kind of knowing here is :sophia:

:praxis: is connected with :phronesis: knowing how to make _wise_ decisions. The most important activity according to this book.

=== Three Charaters ===

_one with experience_

_Technical Expert_

_Scientist_

=== Types of Goods ===

* Those with :intrinsic: ends persued for its own purpose
	* Here the purpose is the activity


* Those for some other ends :instrumental:
=== Questions ===

Does it require you to know how to make practical decisions?

a: everyone needs practical decision making skills

Q: Are goods for the human life internal or external? 
A: :material_causes:
	:formal: what it is made into
	:efficient:
	:final: A things :telos:

### Beginning

1. first things first:
	1. Take Roll
	2. Katie the treasurer for the philosophy club on campus will be speaking to us today about the Philosophy club. Here s/he is now.
	3. Office Hours will be held on Tuesday from 10am - 12pm
	4. Last week we mentioned that you would like to talk about Human enhancement.

### Discussion

1. What is the question:
	1. In 2007, psyciatrist Peter Kramer described the transformation of Tess, (30, grew up in public housing caring for 9 siblings and elderly mother after death of father). Tess, as a result of her traumatic childhood, was a withdrawn, fearful, and unable to form relationships. After taking prozac, an anti-depressant and serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, Tess became less fearful, began dating, left public housing and became independent.
	2. Critics say that her happiness is manufactured.
	3. Cyclists beginning in the 1980's have largely been taking EPO, hormone erythropoietin, a hormonal growth factor that the body creates to stimulate rpoduction of red blodd cells. Red blood cells give an advantage in sports that require heavy use of oxygen. An athelete can achieve the same results by training at high altitudes and other atheletes naturally possess EPO's resulting in a higher concentration of red blood cells.
2. Between the two cases, which one counts as human enhancement? It seems that between the two, the one's benefiting are using medical enhancements to overcome natural limitations which occur in others naturally.
3. I want you to now break into groups and see if you can come up with an answer you agree on. Prepare your reasons so that we can discuss them with the class. It would be best if you assigned someone the task of writing down these reasons.

4. So first, lets determine what the argument is?:
	1. Should American citizens be allowed to enhance themselves?
	2.

What is the relation between a reason and an action when reason explains the action by giving the agent’s reason for doing what he did? (rationalizations) Conclusion: Rationalization is a species of causal explanation.

1. A reason rationalizes an action only if it leads us to see something the agent saw, or thought he saw, in his action-some feature, consdquence, or aspect of the action the agent wanted, desired, prized, held dear, thought dutiful, beneficial, obligatory, or agreeable.

2. Primary reason of an action is its cause. a. light switch - shows that rationalizations involve naming reasons for primary action, not related effects.:
	1. C1. R is a primary reason why an agent performed the action A under the description d only if R consists of a pro attitude of the agent towards actions with a certain property, and a belief of the agent that A, under the desciption d, has that property.

3. Distinction between intention and primary reason: To know primary reason for action is to know the intention for action. But intention is not necessary to know primary reason. Primary reason = Justification and Explanation
	1. Belief desire pair must connect in the right sort of way with the action.

Because there is a primary reason, an action is revealed with certain traits. These highlight the role of the agent as “rational agent”.

Additionally, C1 must be augmented with C2: A primary reason for an action is its cause. C1. R is a primary reason why an agent performed the action A under the description d only if R consists of a pro attitude of the agent towards actions with a certain property, and a belief of the agent that A, under the desciption d, has that property. C2. A primary reason for an action is its cause

1. Events are closely assoicated with the primary reason.:
	1. but how?:
		1. Causal explanations
		2. Reasons explanation

### Some Objections

1. Rationalizations do not involve laws but causal explanations do.
2. Causal explanations do violence against human freedom
3. 3 dEviate causal explanations:
	1. Spilt drinks - though you have belief/desire, the action is the same as if you didn't 
	2.

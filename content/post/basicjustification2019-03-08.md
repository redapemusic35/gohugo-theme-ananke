# Introduction

Internalism says that those factors which differentiate knowledge from merely true belief are entirely internal to the believing agent. However many epistemologists no longer believe that internal factors account for all of the possible factors which are salient in knowledge attribution.[^1]
Internalists can be distinguished from externalists. While internalists argue that there is some particular feature of justification for their belief that that person has access to. For instance, some internalists may attribute knowledge only on the basis of reflection, where the agent's ability to reflect on why and how a belief they hold is knowledge [^2]. In summary, internalists argue that what can be known by someone who knows, must known in a way that the agent knows that they know.

However, externalists have argued that there are more factors contributing to one's knowledge that the agent does not have access to in the same way that internalists argue is required. In these cases, we would still attribute knowledge however. that some causally salient factors in knowledge attribution are those which are external to the agent. In consequence, religious epistemologists have begun to argue that on this basis, one is justified in attributing knowledge given religious experiences such as perception. As such, externalist accounts in religious epistemology are motivated by trends in general epistemology where knowledge is attributed to individuals based on factors which can include those that are external to the agent. Further, given these trends, knowledge is not based solely on a few factors, but many factors, some which are internal and some which are external to the agent.

On externalist accounts of knowledge, knowledge is attributed given factors which are not just internal to the individual whom knowledge is attributed to, but external as well. Virtue epistemologists who are externalists, argue that the epistemic properties of knowledge can be explained in terms of the
|epistemic properties of persons [@grec12vea]. For virtue epistemologists, such epistemic properties might include things like cognitive faculties. Given the fact that an agent only had *some* control over what cognitive faculties she has, these are often thought of as external to the agent.

[^1]: I use *Knowledge-Attribution*, in the way that Jon Greco uses the term [@grec10akva], it is a term, Greco argues, which is used to denote sources of useful information. When we ascribe knowledge to someone, we are saying that they are a useful source of information.

## Road Map

In section 1, I will present Greco's knowledge as success from ability (KSA) account of knowledge. I will then go on to explain how Alvin Plantinga's proper function argument and William Alston's cohere with Greco's KSA account.
In Section 2, I will present Miracchi's properly basic account of knowledge. Beginning with her criticism of indirect virtue epistemology (IVE), I will show those concerns which Miracchi's account presents for KSA. I then defend Miracchi's account against possible objections motivated by a traditional virtue epistemology.
In section 3, I will present an argument showing how religious beliefs are justified given Miracchi's account of knowledge. In section 4, I conclude by concerns that I have which would require additional work.

# Section 1

## Section 1.1 Religious KSA Account.  Religious Knowledge as Success from Ability
 
On virtue theories of knowledge, the epistemic properties of knowledge are explained in terms of the epistemic properties of persons [@grec12vea]. As such, in some cases of knowledge attribution, knowledge is explained in terms of the epistemic competence of the knowing agent.

For instance, Ernst Sosa has argued [@sosa15jaaa; @sosa15veca; @sosa10hcma; @sosa10kfwa] that similar to actions, beliefs are also performances wherein the aim of belief is knowledge but in the right way, through the competence of the agent performing the action. The correlation between belief and action occurs given that actions have an aim, and aims cannot be achieved by occurrences of luck. John Greco's KSA [@grec10akva] account of knowledge explains this in more detail.

For some epistemologists, belief is similar to action. Further, action is a kind of performance. When we evaluate an agent performing some particular action, care is taken to ensure that the agent does deserve credit for the performance of that action. An agent does deserve credit if and only if credit for that action cannot be given to someone else, or attributed in any way to some other factor, such as luck.

According to virtue epistemologists, we attribute knowledge as an accomplishment in the same way that we attribute the performance of an action as a kind of competence. The fact that the activities of the agent are responsible for the accomplishment in question is a reason to attribute competence to that agent. In the same way, we also attribute knowledge.  The activities and competences of the agent are important because we want to know that the accomplishment, obtaining knowledge or performing action, was done in such a way as to preclude lucky occurrences of that accomplishment.

Consider cases where we would not attribute knowledge to an individual. Chisholm's sheep case is one such case where knowledge is not attributed to the agent though the agent does hold a true belief.

> When a man takes there to be a sheep in the field and does so under conditions which are such that, when a man does thus take there to be a sheep in the field, then it is evident to him that there is a sheep in the field. The man, however, has mistaken a dog for a sheep and so what he sees is not a sheep at all. Nevertheless unsuspected by the man, there is a sheep in another part of the field [@grec10akva, 74] 

In this case, though the agent does hold a true belief 'that there is a sheep in the field', his belief is not a manisfestation of his intellectual competence. The belief then was not achieved in the right way. The agent in this case does not believe 'because' of an intellectual ability [@grec10akva, 75].

## Section 1.2

There is a problem with the above treatment however. While it might account for a wide range of Gettier cases, it will not account for all Gettier cases. In the above case, the agent's true belief was not a manifestation of his intellectual ability. But what about cases where the agent's true belief *is*  a manifestation of his true belief and yet the agent still does not *know*?

Externalists argue that the factors salient in knowledge attribution are varied. On virtue theories of knowledge for instance, knowledge is attributed given the epistemic competences of the agent. 

> Henry is driving in the countryside and sees a barn ahead in clear view. On this basis he believes that the object he sees is a barn. Unknown to Henry however, the area is dotted with barn facades that are indistinguishable from real barns from the road. However, Henry happens to be looking at the one real barn in the area. [@grec10akva, 76] 

Here, even though Henry's belief *is* a manifestation of his intellectual ability, he could have just as easily been wrong about his belief. This is because there is no reason for us to expect that Henry's intellectual capacities to operate in his current environment. As such, we expect that one's abilities are specifically suited to particular environments.

In Greco's account, there are three aspects which we naturally think important in a case of knowledge attribution. First, we want to know whether, (a) It is context sensitive. What we care about, is whether the agent's epistemic faculties are suited to function in the given environment. Next, we care about whether, (b) it is related to practical reasoning. We want to know whether or not the question of whether the individual has knowledge, is related in a practical way to the one who attributes knowledge. If I am attributing knowledge to some individual, what I care about is whether the thing I am referencing in the knowledge attribution, is important to me. This leads us to, (c). Is my use of the attribution, a flag for good sources of information. If the question of whether the knowing individual is important to the individual giving the attribution, then there is some way in which it is important. This will be true if it can be said that the knowing individual is a good source of information for the individual who is contributing knowledge.

With (c), when we say that knowledge attribution is a flag for good sources of information, we are saying that some agent is valuable in a particular way. This has to do with a particular virtue that the agent has. We might consider someone like Sammy Sosa who is really good at catching fly balls during a baseball game. However, Sammy is not so good at catching fly balls in a war. As such, Sammy's competence is an explanatorily salient factor in his catching fly balls during a baseball game. But I would not expect it to be an explanatorily salient factor in his catching fly balls during a war.

Therefore KSA is context sensitive, meaning that it takes into account conditions (shifting circumstances within an environment) and the environment (sets of relatively stable circumstances) in which the belief is held. On Greco's KSA account of knowledge then, a knowing agent "believes the truth because [the agent] believes from intellectual ability. It is in these cases that we attribute knowledge to the agent." [@grec10akva, 101]  

## Section 1.3

According to classical foundationalism, there are some kinds of knowledge that must be grounded and some that do not need such treatment. However, classical foundationalism has been rejected by contemporary epistemology. Narrow internalism, the view that beliefs are justified on factors which are internal to the agent, has also been rejected by contemporary epistemologists. Further, given Alvin Plantinga's Proper Function Argument and William Alston's Perception of God, we can see how these trends have been rejected by religious epistemologists as well.

### 1.3.1 William Alston's Defence of Basic Religious Perception

In "Perceiving God", William Alston [@alst86pga] argues that the perception of God, with respect to religious belief, plays a role similar to that played by sense perception, with respect to beliefs about the material world. Further, these perceptual experiences can justify an agent's belief, which in turn translates the agent's belief into knowledge for that agent. Human beings engage in a number of basic doxastic practices. 

For instance, if I perceive that a car is heading at a fast rate of speed towards some individual, I might quickly form the belief that that individual ought to get out of the way. Assuming that I believe that the individual is capable of hearing me, I might utter "get out of the way!". Interestingly enough however, that individual will most likely do so based on my utterance. Quickly, that individual will treat me as a source of important information for their own purposes. 

For Alston, what qualifies an agent's practices as basically doxastic, is that "each of these involve a distinctive sort of input to belief-forming mechanisms". As such, my perceiving of the car, qualifies as a distinctive sort of input. And each practice, including that of perception,  has its own range of contents and set of functions that determine the belief contents as a "function of input features."

Given Alston's treatment, we can classify a religious belief as arising
when there is a distinctive range of contents (subject matter and ways of conceiving
it). A set of functions that determine belief contents as a function of input
features. And experiential practices which we might think of as: socially extablished, shared, inculcated, reinforced and propogated. A particular function of this type may include, religious perceptions, and other types of religious experiences. However, one may argue that doxastic practices of this sort are not widely accepted.

There is a debate in literature surrounding the epistemology of testimony. Whether testimonial knowledge reduces down to other types of knowledge such as inference; Greco argues [@grec12rwtb] that anti-reductionist fair better in the face of evidential objections and the problems of religious plurality.[^3] To understand how this works, we may look at the way that communities evaluate testimony. These include (a) The quality of the testimonial transaction, (b) The quality of the original source, and (c) The quality of the social relations underwriting the testimonial exchange. Further, we are now beginning to recognize sources of knowledge derived from our testimonial exchanges and doing so if very important to knowledge. Looking at (d) we might say that it compares to the baseball case above in the following way:  in the same way that a baseball talent scout is concerned with whether Sammy Sosa is a good source of homeruns in an context which he cares about, the religious person is also concerned with whether someone is a good source of knowledge in a domain in which she cares about. Because the attribution works in the same way as it does in non-religious contexts, it is difficult to see why we can not also apply it in religious contexts as well.

[^3]: Some other work on the nature of doxastic practices in the context of religious communities includes [@bent18gaia].

### 1.3.2 Plantinga's Proper Function

A very fine point in externalist epistemology, is that knowledge sources can be found in a wide variaty of places. Alvin Plantinga has developed an account of proper function in regards to knowledge. Recall that in Greco's KSA account above, we might attribute knowledge based on the individual, the setting at which the individual operates best and those faculties with which the individual has at her disposal.

PFK: S knows *p* only if (a) *p* is true, (b) S's belief is the result of properly functioning cognitive faculties, (c) S's faculties are operating in an appropriate environment, and (d) when functioning properly in an appropriate environment, S's faculties reliably produce true beliefs rather than false beliefs. 

How might we know that our cognitive capacities are functioning properly? Even assuming that our knowledge is to be explained in terms of reliable doxastic practices, what makes us think that these practices are reliable unless we already know that our cognitive faculties are functioning properly, assuming that you cannot show that you know?

Greco argues that we can agree that this challenge has been met without undermining our epistemic position. Next, this objection does not show that we do not have knowledge of the world. Therefore, the response given by religious epistemologists such as Plantinga and Alston hold that explanations of religious belief tend to focus on the intuitions that we do not require similar type accounts for basic and perceptual knowledge.

Neither should we expect to do so on the assumption that God exists. There is a difference between understanding and knowledge. When someone asks us to explain our beliefs, they are asking to help understand those beliefs. But understanding is not needed for knowledge.

# 2 Reliable Gettier Problems

Lisa Zagebski argues that to create a Gettier style counter example, we first need to establish an accident involving otherwise reliable faculties which become unreliable as a result of this accident. Further, we need to entail some further consequent situation wherein by some further disconnected accident, the agent hits on the truth anyway [@zagz97vmia]. In the first amendment to the problematic situation, whatever it is that justifies the belief is strong enough such that the belief would otherwise be warranted. However, owing to an accident, it turns out that the belief is false. Zagzebski further imagines that in Gettier cases, one imagines a further incidence of luck which makes it turn out to be the case that the belief is true after all. However, the aspect of the belief which makes the belief true, is independent of whatever it was that justified the belief initially.

## Section 2.1 Gettier Problems of Religion

So therefore, 

> Consider Josh, a 1st century pagan in France. After a freak accident involving a herd of pigs, Josh (who is extremely precocious) develops a series of phobias which manifest as a highly restrictive set of dietary and sanitary habits. Luckily for Josh, when his village contracts plague, Josh is spared on account of his unique dietary and sanitary habits. Mary, an unrepentant pagan servant girl from the neighboring convent, sees Josh feverishly washing his hands one day and mistakenly thinks that Josh is praying and repenting of his sins. Previously unconvinced by the nun's repeated attempts to convert her, Mary attributes Josh's luck in avoiding the plague (she knows that everyone in his village died) to God's providence on account of her misperception of Josh. She subsequently forms the belief that God exists.

Mary has been Gettiered. This is because her otherwise reliable cognitive faculties (her sensus divinitatis) are not reliable for her. Further, we can attribute this case of bad luck to an accident. It is an accident that Josh developed the life saving habits that he did. Further, it is an accident that she thinks Josh is repenting of his sins, he's as much of a pagan as he has ever been. If Plantinga is correct, then God would have created Mary's cogntive faculties in such a way as to produce true beliefs for her. Her sensus divinitatis then would also have been created in such a way as to produce true beliefs for Mary. However, in this case, what would have triggered a true religious belief, the witnessing of a miracle, produces an unreliable belief, 'Josh believes in God'. However, Mary, because of luck, forms the true belief that "God exists". That is what has happened in this case. It is unlucky for Mary that she is unable to form the true belief given the effort of the nuns in her convent, however it is a case of good luck that witnessing and misunderstanding Josh's actions, she forms the correct true belief anyway.

## Section 2.2

There are two options available for someone defending a view of religious knowledge. Given indirect virtue epistemology, 'knowledge is an achievement which is explained by a knower's competence to believe truly' [@grec09kasa; @sosa07veva; @sosa10kfwa]. However, under this view, knowledge can still be attributed to a case of bad luck.

Miracchi argues that Indirect virtue epistemology, with regard to Gettier cases, will always fail. Theories which place the object of performance on something short of knowledge, will fail to explain the way in which knowledge is an achievement of that performance. IDE fails because it attempts to define knowledge as an achievement that is explained by the knower's competence to do something other than know. Therefore, this account is belief-first because it articulates knowledge in terms of true belief. As such, knowledge is not characteristic of competences that explain knowledge. 

Miracchi then gives a procedure which is supposed to show why the indirect view will always fail in response to Gettier problems. She argues that one starts with a Gettier case. Then specify some additional fact such that it is separate from whatever fact it is that justifies the belief. What Miracchi's counter example adds is some additional feature such that when the agent encounters that which justifies the belief, and a bit of bad luck such that the belief is not knowledge, she will encounter some good luck such that her true belief is a result of a characteristic manifestation of her competence. Yet the subject still does not have knowledge.

Miracchi's own virtue epistemology however, explains knowledge in terms of knowledge. While this might initially sound circular, it is not because knowledge and basic justification are thought of as justifying belief. The relationship between belief and knowledge then is a disjunctive one. If one disjunct turns out false, then the belief would not be justified. Yet the agent still possesses knowledge.

# Bill Gates' Generosity

Here, I will mostly inquire whether Bill Gates is magnanimous, or some other trait. In the end, I think that what he represents, is something which we all might relate to which is have each of these character traits in one degree or another and the degree which we have them, whether virtuous or vicious, is constitutive of our characters. Not that we do not have them in any respect.

## Bill Gates is Magnanimous

Magnanimity implies that an individual has a theoretical grasp on what it is appropriate to spend large sums of money on, and what it is not appropriate to spend large sums of money on. According the website: gatesfoundation.org, the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, through the giving of large sums of money, hope to:
Save and increase the well-being of individuals across the globe. They would accomplish this through providing 

* education
* financial
* medicinal
* technological
* environmental
* agricultural
* science

Improve access to 

* nutrition

They also strive to inspire similar pursuits in others. As such, they provide grants, education and the like to those who want to emulate their practices:

### Appropriateness

To say that generosity in a particular context is appropriate, merely refers to Aristotle's view that giving, should be done for the sake of *kalon*   (@burg08a, p. 83). The magnificent person, partly on account of his generosity, should be able to be seen as great, or having a great soul.

To view this in a opposite context, there might be some who while giving in such a way to to have been considered magnanimous, would those witnessing the giving agree that they are a person with a great soul? To be such, one would have to be able to view themselves as "worthy of great things" (1124a15). In this way, we might think of Bill Gates as being magnanimous given that that which he is capable of in his giving is not likely to be surpassed.


### Size

It is indisputable that the size of the Gates' giving would alone qualify them to be considered truly magnanimous. However, in considering what is and is not virtuous, we have to consider more than just the size, but we also have to consider the whether it is appropriate, whether its aims are noble, and whether or not those aims were achieved.

### Effectiveness

One way to determine the affect then, is look and see what the aims of the Gates' foundation are, and whether or not these are being accomplished. In looking to see what the aims are, Are the aims noble? I think that most agree that if the aims I mentioned earlier, are truly those of the Gates foundation, then yes, Bill and Melinda Gates have noble aims.

## Bill Gates is not Magnanimous

There is some controversy surrounding the manner in which Bill Gates acquired his wealth. The question is whether or not this controversy would disqualify him from magnanimity as a characteristic trait. The only way it would do so, is if in his case, his large giving is not a virtue. This could happen, for instance, if his giving failed in degree of magnitude, appropriateness, or outcome. For instance if it did not result in great outcomes.

### Foundation of Generosity

In determining many of the characteristics of a magnanimous person, we have to first understand those characteristics of a generous person since the characteristics of a generous person only differ from those of a magnanimous person by the degree of the expenditure.  A person who is magnanimous is only such owning to the amount that he is able to divest and presumably, the amount of good that is possible as a result.

#### Giving and Getting Wealth

The vices and virtues of generosity are those which will prevent, in part, a generous person from every becoming magnanimous. For instance, a generous person, in a medial condition with respect to the vices of wastefulness and acquisitiveness, will not waste her wealth frivolously. She will only give to those she should, in accordance with what she is able. However, if she does err, it will be on the side of giving too much, to what she should. "What is exceedingly characteristic of a generous person is even to be excessive in giving, so that he leaves less for himself, since it is characteristic of a generous person not to look out for himself." (1120b4-6").

The one who is acquisitive, will not have wealth for long. Not only do they get wealth from places that they shouldn't, but they do so because they desire to spend more than what they have, ensuring that they will not have those resources to draw from in the future.

#### Sizable Contribution

Sizable contributions are not only sizable in they quantity, but it seems that they are also sizable in their quality. "His works, then, are also like that, since that is the way the expenditures will be great and appropriate to the work. Thus the work should be worthy of the expenditure and the expenditure should be worthy of the work..." (1120b2-5) "

Further, it seems that the magnificent person has wisdom in the area to which she is giving. "A magnificent person is like someone with scientific knowledge, since he is able to get a theoretical grasp on what is appropriate and spend great sums in a suitable way." (1122b33-35)

### Controversy

So of the accusations against the way Bill Gates acquired his wealth, has to do with practices that his company engaged in, seemingly at his bequest. For instance, the company would regularly provide training and resources to developing programmers, but they would then acquire the rights to the proceeds of this development. This ensured that other individuals and companies would not be able to derive any benefit from these programs accept through Microsoft.

As a result of many of these practices, Microsoft weathered various antitrust lawsuits and been accused of engaging in anti-competitive practices. The question is however, whether or not such accusations would disqualify the Gates foundation and Bill and Melinda Gates from the virtue of magnificence?

### The Penurious

As mentioned by Steven, one extreme to magnanimity is one who is penurious. The penurious seems most of all to be motivated by not parting with more than he absolutely has to. Regarding subordinates, he charges for any amount lost by the subordinate. Here, it is not necessarily the case that the penurious does not have the funds to replace what is lost by the subordinate. To the contrary, it is most likely the subordinate who does not have the funds to replace what what lost to the penurious.

This description does not seem to fit Bill Gates. Gates might have been extremely competitive in an area where others sought to share their intellectual products more liberally than he. However, in a 1976 letter written to the open source hobby community accusing them of stealing software, Gates articulated a good reason why someone might want to protect their intellectual property in the manner that he has, is that doing so encourages future development.

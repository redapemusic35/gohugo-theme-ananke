In his function argument, Aristotle questions what it means for human beings to flourish with flourishing being the obtainment of the good of a thing. Since, for everything, there is some good for that thing, there is also a good for human beings. The good for human beings is happiness.

According to Aristotle, every object, whether knife, or human being, that pursues various activities, pursue those activities for the sake of some good. The question he then asks however, is whether some of these ends are more desirable than others. Further, there exists some good or end, that no other goods are sought for.

Happiness is 'some activity of the soul in accord with reason'.[@reev14a] For people, the activity of the soul for humans is to live in accord with reason. Purpose, or telos is the 'goal' or 'end' of an object. This means that all activities, all pursuits are done for that one purpose.

Therefore living cannot be the function of a human being since it is not something unique to human beings. 

However, why should it be the case that a things function is something that is unique to that thing? 

Moving on, human beings also have perceptual capacities, therefore it might be the case that what a human's function is to live as a perceiving thing. However, humans share this trait with animals, and therefore it is not unique to human beings. 

The capacity to reason however, is a trait that is unique to human beings. This is because, of all creatures, human beings have the ability to reflect on their thoughts. Therefore, reasoning is a trait that is unique to human beings; human function, then, is to live in accordance with reason.

Human beings use reason to live practically. The part that is unique to human beings, is their capacity to reason. Further, reasoning is a practical way for humans to live practically.

There are two parts of the soul which fulfills its purpose in accordance with reason. The first, the

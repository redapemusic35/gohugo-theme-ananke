# Abstract

Lisa Miracchi defends what she calls a “Direct Virtue Epistemology” stating that her direct virtue epistemology fairs better than indirect virtue epistemologies popularized by Ernst Sosa and John Greco against a particular Gettier problem. She bases her account on Williams’ knowledge first epistemology wherein knowledge is conceived of as a mental state that is more fundamental than belief. While her approach may work for an Aristotelian virtue epistemology; I approach the question of how Miracchi’s account fairs in relation to an Aquinian virtue epistemology, on which, true virtues are not habituated, but rather are infused dispositions received through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, at the moment at which a person acquires faith.

# Knowledge First Epistemology

In Epistemology, what I will call the traditional view is the idea that that feature which converts true belief into knowledge is some aspect which we often refer to as justification JTB. What entails justification however has been the subject of controversy for 1000's of years [^fn]. At various points throughout the debates history, it has been argued that what entails justification is evidence, reason, relationship among beliefs, access of the true belief to the believer. 

While traditional epistemology is characterized in this way, contemporary epistemology is often characterized by the fact that epistemologists no longer feel that justification does equate to knowledge. Some reasons for this transition include realizations that for as many theories of JTB that there are, there are counter examples showing why it is that these theories do not work. These counter examples have come to be known as Gettier examples, named after Edmund Gettier who devised the first counter example to JTB beginning the current era of epistemology.

Not only do contemporary epistemologists not accept JTB, but they also have a much broader conception of just which features contribute to knowledge. The reason that I say broader, is because epistemologists now accept knowledge as being derivative of more than just the knowing agent. Rather, features of knowledge might now include such facts as the agent's environment, the agent's community, the agent's cognitive faculties.[^fn]

[^fn]: By cognitive faculties what I mean are such things that are outside of the agent's control. For instance, the neurological properties of the agent, arguably those which the agent does not have direct control over, though they might be able to add influence by way of cognitive exercises and the like. (disputable)

One popular view currently is what is often revered to as virtue epistemology. In its traditional conception, proposed by the likes of Ernst Sosa [@sosa07veva; @sosa10kfwa; @sosa15jaaa] and John Greco [@grec10akva; @grec12vea; @grec12vecb] virtue epistemologists argue that knowledge is derivative of the epistemic competences of the knowing agent. As such, for instance, [@gre10akva, p. 73] argues that knowledge is what is attributed to certain agents depending on whether or not we believe that that agent is a source for some thing that is important to our lives. In the case of knowledge, this thing that is important to us is information.

> Finally, I want to take seriously an idea from Edward Craig that is not uncontroversial, but I think very plausible. Specifically, that one purpose of the concept of knowledge is to flag good sources of information.

Assuming this, what is distinctive of human beings, is this idea that we are communal beings. We live in communities and as such, there are aspects of this community that are important to our flourishing. For instance, in the community we can find various goods that will contribute to our flourishing. One such good is information by which we may flourish because of its usefulness to us.

Under this theory of beneficial goods then, knowledge is nothing more than a term which we attribute to individuals based on our determination that the particular individual is a valuable source of something important to us, knowledge. As such, when we say that the true belief which some individual holds is knowledge, what we mean to say is that that individual is a good, reliable source of valuable information. What remains to be seen then is what it is that makes someone a valuable source of knowledge.

## Sources of Importance

According to John Greco [@grec12vecb]; the reasons which we ascribe knowledge to some individual depends on 3 factors:

1. First, what we care about when ascribing knowledge to some individual, is importance of that knowledge to our own lives. Typically, we ascribe knowledge because there is something that is important for us given that knowledge. Perhaps a better way to understand this is through analogy. In this sense, knowledge attribution is a form of practical reasoning.
   
   Consider that Sammy Sosa is a great baseball player. Further, consider what it is that makes Sammy Sosa such a great player. It might be the case that he is really good a throwing the ball from the right field to the home plate. If I am a coach looking for my next star player, what I am doing is ascribing various attributes to individual players based on what I care about. Therefore, because I care about right fielding (assuming that I am looking for a right fielder), then what I do in considering Sosa is make an ascription towards him based on my perception of his ability to operate well, doing what I need him to, in the right field.

2. Further, given that what I care about is the right side of a baseball field, another important aspect of knowledge ascription is the context in which I might ascribe knowledge. Here we can also work by way of analogy. As such, this first consideration, is that "knowledge attributions are somehow 'context sensitive'." [@grec12vecb, p. 98] 
 
  1. For instance, imagine that Sammy Sosa is a great right fielder. What I care about then is the right side of a baseball field. What I do not care about however is the right side of a battle field. While it may be true that Sosa can field balls very well whether from a baseball field or a battle field, I do not care about his ability to field from the right side of a battle field and as such, I would not ascribe fielding competence to him based on his ability to do so.
3. This brings me to my last point, that the purpose of knowledge attribution is to "flag good sources of information." [@grec12vecb, p. 98]
 
[^fn]: Not true I merely state this for effect plus I do not want to interrupt my flow.

In 2001, Timothy Williams released his book *Knowledge and Its Limits* [@will00kaia]. In it, he described a new way of looking at the question of *what it means to know*. This new way of understanding knowledge, involves getting rid of all of our old conceptions of justification wherein knowledge is some kind of justified true belief.

Just what justification means, and who is justified and why has changed many times, especially since Edmund Gettier's paper, *Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?* [^2]
[^2]: [@gett63ijta]. Using William's methodology, Lisa Miracchi has argued that traditional virtue theories about belief, wherein knowledge is a competence to believe truly, do not avoid all Gettier problems. 

As such, Miracchi argues that adopting Williams's methodology, she is able to device a virtue theory which will finally avoid all possible Gettier problems. Here, I assume that her theory is adequate to do what she suggests. On this assumption, I question whether the knowledge first approach works equally well for both an Aquinian and Aristotelian epistemology. Or whether it will work on the one approach but not the other.

In the first section, I will define the distinction between Miracchi's *competence to belief truly* and her *competence to know*. In the next section, I go on to apply this to religious epistemology and show why religious epistemologists can use a Miracchi's view in addition. I conclude by demarcating what such a project would look like from an Aristotelian versus Aquinian view point.

# A basic view about beliefs

## Biosemantics [pp. 281 - 297]

In her 1984 paper *Biosemantics* [@milli84bioa], Ruth Millikan argues that what amounts to knowledge in the mind should be distinguished by what is used by which ever faculties use the information to provide a type of flourishing for the creature which is said to benefit from the object known. For instance, she points to a particular one celled organism which lives in the northern hemisphere.[^4] 
[^4]: Here it should be noted that there are similar organisms which live in the southern hemisphere. The example also includes these.

This organism, although it may be said that it has nothing in the way of belief similar to human beings, it can have what amounts to knowledge. In the case of this organism, it uses magnetsomes to orient itself towards the north pole. Further, while these magnetsomes incline the creature to move towards the north pole, it is not the case that the creature *knows* where the north pole is. Neither is it the case that the creature intends to direct itself towards the north pole. Rather, what might be said is the creature's interest is oxygen rich water below the surface. Therefore, rather than orienting itself towards the north pole, the creature benefits from having something like a belief as to where the north pole is and that this belief is somehow useful to the creature.

What I am missing here, is the distinction between semantics, and *knowing*. While it might be said that the distinction as I represent it here is an impossible one to make [^5] 
[^5]: I have nothing to base this on. I do not know that it is impossible to make.
I only make the distinction because Alvin Plantinga [@plan00eana] argues that whatever it is in the mind that we argue is belief, whether it is semantic or otherwise will count. Later I will apply this particular concept to the larger question at hand.

### What Exactly Is the New Evil Demon Problem?

### Externalist Justification for Direct Virtue Epistemology

One particular approach to solving Gettier problems, which has, according to its adherents, made much progress since the 1960's, is virtue epistemology. Prior to Gettier's seminal paper, epistemologists largely thought that knowledge, or what it is to *know*, entailed justified true belief. According to this approach, what a equates to knowledge is a belief that not only is true, but one which also is justified, with justification amounting to proper evidence, rationality, cognitive access and so on. However, what Gettier showed is that justification and true belief were not enough. As such...

### Rational Believing Is A Kind of Properly Valuing Knowledge

### Competent Perspectives

According to the more dominant virtue theorists [^7]
[^7]: [@grec15;sosa07;sosa10;sosa12], 
the competence of the agent is the missing component in knowledge. For instance, consider a typical Gettier problem: 

> Charles was driving along the interstate. As he looked into the distance, he noticed the many barns in the area. Looking at one barn in particular, he noted to himself what a fine looking barn it was.

While we might want to say that the belief, "that is a fine barn" would equate to knowledge if the belief was true, and Charles is justified in holding it, evidence, reason, etc.; if we add the provisio that Charles is in fake barn country and the majority of barns in that area are fake (it is only be coincidence that Charles happened to be looking at the correct barn), then it appears that Charles's belief is not knowledge after all. But why is this?...

According to the preimmanent virtue theories, the reason why is that Charles's belief was not a manifestation of his competence. As such, virtue theorists argue that the component missing in traditional theories, is that of the competence of the agent, wherein knowledge rests on the competence of the agent to believe truly. From here on, I will refer to this theory as indirect virtue theories, or IDE for short.

### Conclusion: Diagnosing the New Evil Demon Problem

## Competent Knowing

There have been quite a few responses to IDE. However, due to space constraints, the one that I will focus on primarily in this paper, is one offered by Lisa Miracchi. According to Miracchi, while IDE has brought epistemology a long way towards solving Gettier problems, we cannot yet put them to rest. According to Miracchi, what IDE lacks, are considerations of those cases wherein an agent does have a true belief, and that true belief rests on her competence to believe truly.

She gives the example of an agent, who being in hard-working sheep dog country wherein upon noticing a sheep dog, there will always be a sheep nearby, mistakes a sheep dog for a sheep. Subsequently, the agent forms the belief that "there is a sheep".

> Consider Anne, who is in sheep dog country. Looking ahead, she notices what appears to her to be a sheep. She then forms the belief "there is a sheep". However, unknown to her, what appears to her to be a sheep is in fact a sheep dog.

###### Knowing and Acting: 

Knowledge and action are the central relations between mind and world. Knowledge entails that mind is adapted to the world. When world is maladapted to mind there is the residue of desire. When mind is maladapted to world, there is residue of belief. Desire aspires to action while belief aspires to knowledge.

###### Contemporary accounts of mind 

Tend to marginalize the category of knowledge, sometimes not mentioning it at all; they certainly make it less central than the category of action.

###### The idea that belief 

Is conceptually prior to knowledge has another source: the internalist conception of mind, and world external to mind, as two independent variables.

###### Given that belief 

Is conceptually prior to knowledge, then evidence and justification are conceptually prior to knowledge too.

###### Knowledge is a mental state 

That constitutes the evidential standard for assertion and belief.

###### When knowing p 

Requires a margin for error, the cases in which p is known are separated from the cases in which p is false by a buffer zone, a protective belt of cases in which p is true but unknown.

###### The central claim 

Is that knowing is a state of mind. A state of mind is a mental state of a subject.

### Knowledge and Perception.pdf

The normal way in which IDE would address this question is to say that Anne's belief does not rests on her competence. In order for something to rest on an agent's competence, there are various factors which need to be considered [@grec10aka]. First, for instance; we have to consider whether the current environment is one for which the agent's capacities are designed to operate. 

John Greco argues that we consider the environment, context, and roll of the knower. The reason why these are important, is because knowledge is merely a way of denoting the source of some resource which is important to us. He argues that there are aspects of one's mental states which are useful to other individuals. As such, one who has such mental states then, is recognized by a community of individuals who might benefit from this particular source.

In Anne's case, Anne's belief does not amount to knowledge because the three requirements above are not satisfied. For instance, while the environment may be conducive to the proper operation of her cognitive faculties, we have not asked about the context of her belief, nor of the roll of her agency in producing the belief [^3]
[^3]: Fill in later. Essentially, there is the problem what is Anne's purpose in being in the field? Is she counting sheep? Is she hiking? Is she looking for a particular sheep? This is important because we might attribute knowledge to a particular belief based on the reasons that we might have in doing so. If I hired Anne, for instance, to count the sheep in my field, then I might have reason to attribute knowledge to her belief that "there is a sheep". However, if I am merely walking alongside Anne, then I might be more cautious in attributing knowledge to her belief. In any respect, this is not something that I need to get into her.

# Knolwedge First Religious Epistemology

## Basically, We Can Know God!

### Traditionally Epistemology

Epistemology has been engaged in two projects. The ‘Project of Explanation’ is to explain what knowledge is. This is the project of Plato’s Theaetetus, where Socrates asks, ‘What is knowledge?’ and ‘How does knowledge differ from true opinion’? The ‘Project of Vindication’ is to show or prove that we do indeed have knowledge. This project is closely associated with the Pyrrhonian skeptical tradition, which argues that the project cannot be successfully carried out. A fourth trend in contemporary epistemology is to embrace the first project and to reject the second. More strongly, the Project of Vindication is now viewed as importantly misguided, and perhaps even incoherent.

### Perceiving God

#### The Perception of God

In "Perceiving God", William Alston argues that the perception of God, with respect to religious belief, plays a role similar to that played by sense perception, with respect to beliefs about the material world. Further, these perceptual experiences can justify an agent's belief, which in turn translates the agent's belief into knowledge for some knowing agent.

Human beings engage in a number of basic doxastic practices. For Alston, what qualifies an agent's practices as basically doxastic, is that "each of these inovolve a distinctive sort of input to belief-forming "mechanisms". Each practice has its own range of contents and set of functions that determine the belief contents as a "function of input features." Given Alston's treatment, we can classify a religious belief as arising when there is: A distinctive range of contents (subject matter and ways of conceiving it) A set of functions that determine belief contents as a function of input features. (a) Experiential practices: Socially established. Socially Shared. inculcated. reinforced. propagated. (b) Inferential practices: input: beliefs, forming beliefs,

## Positive Epistemic Status and Proper Function

# Basic Habits or Basic Faith?

The goal of the atonement is a life in Grace. What does it mean to say; “A life in Grace?” What is a life in Grace?

A defect in the will is the cause of moral wrongdoing which results in alienation from God.

“A life in grace is the goal of the atonement, and so insight into the nature of the goal [of atonement which is a life in grace] illuminates the means to that goal which is provided by the atonement.” So the question is “what is a life in grace?”

It is not merely that people will to do wrong however, it is that cling to the moral wrong that we will. As such, not only do we fail to will the good, but we also fail to will to will it.

Psychic Fragmentation: It appears that psychic fragmentation is the rejection of having a “will for integration around what is morally good” [I am not sure what this means] But, “human evil fragments a human psyche and leaves it alienated from its self, its best self….” The remedy for this fragmentation is sanctification and justification.

To understand the remedy, it is helpful to examine the process in the reverse order. Therefore we begin with sanctification. Sanctification:

Faith: the means to rescue a person ‘from her own propensity to moral wrong’ and the loneliness which results. Further, it is only by faith that a person is justified.

The will of faith: a global second-order will to have with God’s help, a will that wills the good.

“Where does justification’s higher-order desire for a will that wills the good come from?”

According to Aquinas’s understanding of justifiation by faith, a person without faith has a ‘will that refuses grace’. However, in surrender to God, the refusal giives way to ‘a state of quiescence in the will as regards God’s grace.’ When this occurs, a person’s will is infused with the grace of God. From this, that person forms the global higher-order state of will. From this, that person detests their own past wrongdoings and begins to desire the goodness of God.

Aquinas’s account of justification then is a state wherein faith results in having a will brought about in the individual of faith by God, though the individual with faith maintains control of their will. They acn either refuse grace, fail to refuse grace, God’s giving of grace ultimately depends on the individual’s will.

What distinguishes Aquina’s virtues from Aristotle’s is that for Aristotle, a person is ultimately in part, responsible for his own virtues, while on Aquinas’s account, a person is not. This is because God infuses the virtues into a person given the surrender of that person’s will.

Aristotle’s virtues, according to Aquinas, are acquired whereas Aquinas’s virtues are inflused.

Pelagianism is the thesis that ‘there can be some good of any kind in a human will that is not provided directly or indirectly by God’s grace.” What makes Aquinas anti-pelagian, is that Aquinas disagrees that there is any good in the human will apart from God’s grace.

On Aquinas’s ethics, a person with one true virtue has all of the virtues. It is impossible to have any of the real virtues without having all of the real virtues.

All of the virtues are simultaneously infused. p. 15 At the point in time when they infused in this way, the Holy Spirit begins to indwell that person, at the moment when the person acquires faith. Further at this moment, God becomes available to this person, in order that that person know, love and to enjoy Him.

“The gifts of the Holy Spirit are infused dispositions in the will that render a person attentive to God and apt to follow the inner promptings of God.

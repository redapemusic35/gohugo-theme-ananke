Happiness exists in the realization of fulfilling your purpose. A flute player than achieves Eudaimon whenever the flute player is able to fulfill their purpose in playing the flute. So if everything has a function, what Aristotle calls a purpose, then human beings as a human being ought to also have a function, or a purpose. For the flute player, it has some function, that as a human being, playing the flute helps it to achieve. But why should that be the case?

First, in order to determine what the function a human being has, is, we must determine what is unique to the human being that is not shared with any other things. For instance, human beings are a part of the totality of objects that has life. So it could be the case that a human being's function is to have life. However, humans also share this with plants. Therefore living cannot be the function of a human being since it is not something unique to human beings. 

However, why should it be the case that a things function is something that is unique to that thing? 

Moving on, human beings also have perceptual capacities, therefore it might be the case that what a human's function is is to live as a perceiving thing. However, humans share this trait with animals, and therefore it is not unique to human beings. 

The capacity to reason however, is a trait that is unique to human beings. This is because, of all creatures, human beings have the ability to reflect on their thoughts. Therefore reasoning is a trait that is unique to human beings. Therefore a human being's function is to live in accordance with reason.

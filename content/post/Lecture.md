### Arguments in Socrates

Sometimes, it will be difficult writing a valid argument. It is not an easy task. However, we do have tools available providing assistance. In our case, we will first look at an invalid argument, and then with the help of Socrates, try to make it valid. It is a little bit easier in this case because we are merely assessing someone else's argument. 

But let's see why maybe initially the argument is not  valid. 

But let's try to first evaluate an argument in the Crito. Look on page 47 starting at the second line down from the top. Please split into groups of four, here you are going to discuss what you think the argument for why Socrates should escape and whether you think that it is valid.

#### Socrates should escape, Socrates should not escape

##### Socrates should escape

"Too clear it seems, my dear Socrates, but listen to me even now and be saved. If you die, it will not be a single misfortune for me. Not only will I be deprived of a friend, the like of whom I shall never find again, but many people who do not know you or me very well will think that I could have saved you if I were willing to spend money, but that I did not care to do so. Surely there can be no worse reputation than to be thought to value money more highly than one's friends, for the majority will not believe that you yourself were not willing to leave prison while we were eager for you to do so." (p. 47, top of line C)

Now, can we make this argument valid? How might we do this?:

  1. If you die, then I lose a friend and the majority will think that I value money more than friendships.
  2. There is nothing worse than being thought of as someone who values money more than friendship.
  3. Conclusion, therefore you should escape.:

#### In defense of the premises

##### 1. "If you die, then I lose a friend and the majority will think that I value money more than friendships.

##### 1a. Not only will I be deprived of a friend, the like of whom I shall never find again but,
    1.  We are friends
    2. death is permanent separation from the living
	
> "Surely there can be no worse reputation than to be thought to value money more highly than one's friends, for the majority will not believe that you yourself were not willing to leave prison while we were eager for you to do so."

##### 1b. i. The majority will think that Crito values money more than friendship 

1. Either Socrates is willing to escape or Crito values money more than friendship 
2. Socrates did not escape 
3. Therefore Crito was not willing to spend the money

> "but many people who do not know you or me very well will think that I could have saved you if I were willing to spend money, but that I did not care to do so"

##### 1b. ii. The majority will think that Crito values money more than friendship 

1. Either Socrates is willing to escape and will escape or Crito values money more than friendship
2. Socrates is willing to escape and did not escape 
3. Therefore Crito values money more than friendship

> "for the majority will not believe that yo yourself were not willing to leave prison while we were eager for you to do so."

##### 3. There is nothing worse than to be thought of as valuing money more than friendship

1. The majority will think that I value money more than friendship
2. We should care what the majority thinks
3. Therefore there is nothing worse than the majority thinking that Crito values money more than friendship

#### Why should we care what the majority thinks?

  1. The majority can inflict great harm
  2. The majority can inflict the greatest harm


## Socrates should not escape

#### The majority cannot inflict the greatest harm:

##### 1. The majority can only harm the body

##### 2. Suffering harm to the soul is greater than suffering harm to the body:

  1. The worse harm to the body is death
  2. If you have a good soul when you die than death is a blessing

##### 3. Therefore the majority cannot inflict the greatest harm.

#### Should not Disobey the laws of the State 

  1. You should never disobey the laws of the state
  2. Escaping from prison would be disobeying the laws of the state
  3. Therefore you should not escape from prison

P1: Citizens need organization within a society
P2: Obeying a law saying certain individuals should not be allowed in public creates organization
Conclusion: therefore, citizens should obey the law saying certain individuals should not be allowed in public.

One helpful suggestion is imagining your argument as a valid argument form. In this case, your argument most closely resembles:

All A’s are B’s
All B’s are C’s
Therefore all A’s are C’s

So consider

All citizens need organization in a society,

In other words, citizens are A’s, and things needing organization in a society are B’s.

So all A’s, citizens, are B’s, things needing organization in a society

Now look at the rest of your argument and try to determine how the rest could be changed to fit the form


## 2019-02-14

Today, we are going to look at ways of making arguments better. There are a
numbers of ways to do this, but there are three ways that I would like for us to
focus on today. These include:

1. Looking at a paper line by line.
2. Try to understand which lines are supporting which.
3. Summarize each into as few as we can.

# In practice

So how do we do this in practice? When we have an argument before us, given the
desired outcome of this course, what we want to do is articulate that argument
in the most clear, and concise way possible. 

## The Argument

Socrates has just been condemmed to death. Typically, as he argues, whenever he
is about to do something which might cause harm to him, his powers of prophecy
prevent him from doing so. However, this time, he received no such guidance.

Given this outcome, he takes it as a good thing that we was prevented in this
way. What is the argument for how this might be the case? In other words, why
should we think that this is a good thing that Socrates has been condemmed to
die?

### Valid Argument Forms

We are going to attempt to recreate Socrates' argument using the method from
valid argument forms that was given in your handout on blackboard.

Consider the following: Let us reflect in this way, too, that there is good
hope that death is a blessing and that those who believe death to be an evil
are mistaken:

1. for it is one of two things: either the dead are nothing and have no perception of anything or it is, as we are told, a change and a relocating for the soul form here to another place.

2. If it is complete lack of perception, like a dreamless sleep, then death would be a great advantage.

   1. If death is like this I say it is an advantage, for all eternity would then seem to be no more than a single night.

3. If, on the other hand, death is a change from here to another place, and what we are told is true and all who have died are there, what greater blessing could there be, gentlemen of the jury?
   1. The Greek Heroes reside in Hates.
   2. They would allow me to spend my time in inquiry.

4. Either death is a great advantage, or death is a blessing.
5. Therefore death is not an evil.

1. Either A $\vee$ B
2. A $\rightarrow$ C
3. B $\rightarrow$ D
4. C $\vee$ D
 
### Is Gene Therapy an Unqualified Good?

At this point, not everyone agrees that even preventing genetic disease through
germline gene therapy is an unqualified good. The ability to insert functioning
genes into embryos where their absence would lead to disabling disorders seems,
on the face of it, to be a good thing, a benefit, a gift to the child who would
otherwise be disabled. But, as ethicists have pointed out, germline gene
therapy on embryos does not just prevent genetic disorders, or cure disease, or
control symptoms—all valid goals of medicine. Rather, it prevents an individual
with a given genotype from coming into being. Germline gene therapy, some
claim, is thus a judgment on what genotypes deserve to exist—what kind of
people are wanted and what kind of people are unwanted. Advocates for those
with disabilities protest that germline gene therapy sends a harmful message:
people with disabilities are less valued than people without disabilities.
Germline gene therapy, these opponents say, is no different from aborting
fetuses with inherited disorders and selecting or rejecting embryos on the
basis of their genetic make-up. None of the 3 practices is a gift; all are
eugenic harms against those with disabilities.

1. G = (A or $\neg A$) (Either is an unqualified good, or it is not an unqualified
   good)

2. A $\rightarrow$ B (If it is an unqualified good, then it is a good thing)
3. $\neg B$:
	1. G $\rightarrow$ D (Genetherapy prevents certain genotypes from
	   coming into being.)
	2. D $\rightarrow$ E (Therefore a determination of what kinds of people
	   are wanted)
	   	1. whether people with such and such genotype or
		   without
	3. E $\rightarrow$ F (Therefore it is the same as aborting fetuses with
	   inherited disorders)
	4. F $\neq$ A (Abortion is not a benefit)
	5. F $\rightarrow$ $\neg A$
4. $\neg A$

### Why should we believe 3?

1. Genetherapy prevents certain genotypes from coming into being.
2. Therefore a determination of what kinds of people are wanted:
	1. whether people with such and such genotype or without
3. Therefore it is the same as aborting fetuses with inherited disorders
4. Abortion equals death
5. Death is not a benefit

# Abstract

In Ch 7 of Eleonore Stump's book *Atonement* , she argues that as a result of the fall, human beings are no longer able to will to bring their first order desires under the command/power of their second order desires. However, thankfully, God is able to help by strengthening the human will (grace) in order that the object of God's grace is able to will that their will be integrated in order that her first order desires be brought under the control of her good second order desires.

The problem with humanity argues Stump, is that as a consequence of the Fall, man is now psychically fragmented, meaning that man's first order and second order desires are at odds with one another. Furthermore, the problem is so bad that not only are these desires at odds with one another, but also that each person is unable to even will (will have to discover what this means) that these desires be integrated towards the good. As such, in light of our first and second order wills to not be in alignment, not only do we not find this problematic, but on our own, we could not ever bring it about that these are not in alignment.

In this paper, I will argue that how we understand Stump account of the will depends on which account of agency we accept. What I mean, in part, by psychic fragmentation and what this has to do with human agency is that as a result of the fall, man can no longer will that his first order desires align with his second order desires in order to desire what is good. Furthermore, I operate under the conception that Stump's theory changes given which theory of agency one holds. Therefore, I look at various accounts of human agency and using each as a lens, try to understand what Stump means by "psychic fragmentation" and its relationship to human agency.

# Section 1

Some questions which we might ask initially, in order to start, are a clarification of the various terms that are being used in the debate? Secondly, we might want to understand in what ways do these terms connect with one another? So to begin with, I will first introduce the terms themselves.

## Psychic Fragmentation
 
Psychic fragmentation is the view that we are unable to will our first order desires to align with or correspond with, of our second order desires. One manner in which we might be able to think about this, is to consider some desire that Smith might have for cigarettes. This is difficult to understand, in part, because on one hand, Smith might feel as though he can will himself to desire the good. However it appears that this is not what Stump believes.

In what follows, I will try to parse out what it means to be *psychically fragmented* in Stump's sense:

If we are trying to quit smoking, then it might be the case that we have a first order desire that is a consequence of the wafting odor of cigarette smoke coming from across the table. However, we might also have a second order who's content is that we desire to not have the first order desire. So for instance, when I smell the wafting odor of cigarette smoke, and notice that I desire to smoke a cigarette, I might disapprove this first order desire in me. 

In this respect, my desires are solely responsive to whatever aspects of my current environment which might happen to manifest at a given time. In the case of my first order desires, the aspect of my environment which my desires are responsive to, is the odor of cigarette smoke wafting through the air. Further, not only, in this case are my first order desires responsive of some physical aspect of my environment, but also my second order desires as well. My second order desires in this case are merely responding to my first order desires and in this way are merely responsive to my first order desires in some way. In either case, I am not an agent in which my desires have something to do with my own intentions. 

My second order desires for instance,  might be desires which have approval as their content, of disapproval as their content of my first order desire, either way however, I am not the agent. I might either approve of my first order desire to smoke, or I can disapprove of my first order desire to smoke but whether or not I approve or disapprove, I am not the agent acting.

On one conception of "desire", our desires are solely responsive to forces which either present themselves as objects to be desired or as objects to be repulsed by. Either our desire is attracted or repulsed by some object. So either my second order desires are corresponding with my first order, or they are repulsed by the content of my first order desires.

However, we might also have a will, or some will in that we want it to be the case that we wish that our first order desires were influenced by our second order desires. As such, we might lament the fact that we are unable to influence our first our desires by making it so that they align with our second order desires. The question that this paper addresses, is which concept of agency does this view of the will most closely align with?

## Agency

Of all of the views about agency, in order to understand which view most closely corresponds with Stump's view of the will, we have to understand what the will has to do with the human person who is the host for that particular will(?) In *The Problem of Action*, Harry Frankfurt argued against the traditional conception action in that action is to be distinguished from events by the nature of prior causes that brought about the action so understood.

Frankfurt argues that the problem with the causal account, is that there is not any way to distinguish actions from events in virtue of what specifically is the object of action itself(?) Rather, under the causal view, we would have to know the cause of some happening in order to determine whether it was an action or an event.


# Section 2

What if it is the case that psychic fragmentation is not a bad thing for human agency? For instance, we can imagine a set of affairs wherein it was not the case that we deliberated over whether or not our desires were good or bad. We might think that whatever the objects of our desires are, it just is the case that those things are the things which are good for us to desire.

While it is true, that we as human beings are very often the cause for many of the atrocities that are committed. However, one might think that if it were not for the psychic fragmentation within our psyche, maybe there would be infinitely more evil of which we would be the author. This way, we might think that it is a good thing that our psyches were fragmented in the way that Stump seems to suggest.

Of course it would be better that our psyches were not fragmented in such a way that we only desired properly moral objects of desire. However, while on one hand we could consider what a better state of affair would be, I think that we could argue that assuming that things could not be worse than they are would be going to far. Why should we suppose that things as they are now, with our psyches being what they are, is not the best possible way that things could be?

This I think presents a question of Stump's account that we should address sooner rather than later if we are going to be able to understand what account of agency fits best with her proposed account of the will.

## Psychic Frgamentation and Human Agency: the negative account

Psychic fragmentation is the view that one's first order desires are not properly responsive to one's second order desires. For instance, assuming that I desire to quit smoking, I might then do things which will make it unlikely that I smoke often.

For instance, consider that I might, in a moment of weakness, purchase a pack of cigarettes in order that I fulfill some first order desire to smoke. Afterwards I will throw the pack away so as not to be tempted to smoke again further in the future. If I reflect on the cost of a pack of cigarettes the next time that I have the desire to smoke a cigarette, I might reflect on this cost and my understanding that I will throw the pack away shortly after satisfying my desire which will conflict with another desire that I have to save money.

As such, by engaging in actions which I know will cause me to have to choose between competing desires, I am in effect bringing about a overarching will that I have to bring about some result, in this case, to quit smoking. However what I cannot do, is will myself to have a psychic integration of the will for the good(?)

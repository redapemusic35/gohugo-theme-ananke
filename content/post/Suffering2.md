## Suffering Lecture The cognitive power of man 2019-01-23

1. Aquinas argues that God first questions Job's powers of cognition:
	1. Job argues that God compares man's intelligence with that of a cock.

### Stump 2019-01-30

Honor in two different ways: honor as fame, honor as glory. Honor as fame is important for those bestowing the honor. Honor as glory is good for the one whom receives the honor.

Summary:

Adversity can either 

God's speech shows His wisdom and power. Wisdom can be understood as knowledge of what is good to do. 

But:

This cannot be the right way to end becuase it goes against the story and it seems to be inhuman. Why does it seem that there should be a morally sufficient reason?

Aquinas' version is does not seem humane. If Job had cared more about children on earth than glory in heaven, story of Job would repudiate Aquinas' treatment.

Aquinas' account does not take account of the fact that humans are embodied particulars.

1. Wisdom
2. Power
3. Justice:
	1. Answers only one account of happiness, the general account
	2. Does not address the subjective
4. Human account considers two accounts of happiness, general and subjective

#### Some questions from reading 2-1-2019

Why does Job remain silent after God's display of power and knowledge speech? God asks him this question after His speech. Job's answer is that in light of his misplaced accusations, has nothing to say. 

But what in God's speech shows that God has spoken thoughtlessly?

Aquinas seems to think that Job, in his speech gave his friends occasion to question God's positive attributes. 

"Consider here that Job is speaking in the presence of God and his conscience does not accuse him of speaking falsely or of proud intention, for he had spoken from the purity of his soul, but of thoughtlessness in speech. This is because, even if he had not spoken from pride of soul, his words still seemed to taste of arrogance, and so his friends took occasion of scandal."


### REdfield 2019-01-30 pt. 2

1. "I have a lot of power: Rejects"
2. Wisdom-Power = Justice:
	1. Did not understand what he was uttering. v.3
	2. Recognized God's pwer. v.2
	3. Job's friends being humiliated.:
		1. The friends had desented from the "truth of faith"
		2. Requires two remidiarys: Job and friends, Job and God on behalf of friends

		
Why is it a sufficient conclusion for God to appeal to pwoer and wisdom in answer to Job's initial complete?

One plausible answer to Job's acquiecense, is that what Job wsanted were answers which he could only get from face to face dialog with God. When he gets that, the second component of happiness is met. Job lets go of his claim. 

Job's sin was pride, hubris. By coming face to face with God, Job realized where he sinned.

The truth of faith: To assert that you cannot say anything more. Faithfulness that something is demonstrated. 

Question: Is this rational to experiencial knowledge of God? 

Answer: Is a move from epistemological access of God to something else, :truth of faith:

## Reading Notes 

### 2019-02-10

Possible opening for Suffering paper:

Currently, epistemologists largely accept that our perceptions entail knowledge; meaning that what we perceive to be true amounts to knowledge. Consequently, religious epistemologists also hold this to be true of religious beliefs. Although it has been argued that this is a recent change in our thinking regarding the nature of knowledge [1^], in this paper I will show that there as at least some historical precedent for this kind of thinking.

3 Types of Suffering

1. For the sake of discipline:
	1. For the sake of modifying behavior
2. For the sake of punishment:
	1. Clears guilt
	2. Eliminates disease and harm as a result of sin(?)
3. Testing and Trial:
	1. Reward for having passed the trial
	2. God knew beforehand that the tried would be successful
Question: What about those who've lost faith as a result of suffering?

1. Testing in Three words:
	1. Property and persons
	2. Body p. 161
	3. Soul p. 161
2. Soul, as a type of suffering is for the purposes of sacrifice. This is the kind of suffering that children who perish, and irrational animals experience. The consequence is not requital since they were not rational beings, but rather recompense.

### Bounties

1. Creation
2. Requital of rational beings for their prior actions
3. Recompense for tribulations

### 3 types of injustice

1. The ignorance of the judges.
2. Covetousness, judge desires something from the accused or promised something from the accuser(?)
3. Intimidation, either the judge is being intimidated, or intimidating the accused.

### Chastisement and Trial

1. Chastisement does not necessarily mean guilty of sin. But seems possible that is for the sake of building character. Is this then similar to testing and trial?
2. Trial - for the sake of future recompense. Obviously I've done something wrong here. Otherwise it is hard to see how trial is any different than chastisement.

### God only causes suffering on the guilty

#### Argument for Job's guilt

1. Either job is guilty or God has wrong him.
2. God cannot do wrong (logical necessity versus moral must, :Divine Voluntarism:)
3. therefore Job is guilty

### 3 ways God can blessing

1. Repentence of Prior sins
2. Merit
3. Trial and Tribulation

### Points Saadia considers important

1. Who is Satan:
	1. What he says
	2. His role
2. Job's sufferings
3. Arguments of friends
4. Exegesis of texts
5. Benefactions of God's speech

### Translation Techniques

1. Reasoned Proofs
2. Linguistic Usage
3. Common Historical Tropes

### Themes During Lecture 2019-02-06

1. First, for God to afflict an individual solely for the good of others is assumed to be unjust.
2. Saadiahs metaphysic of justice punishment is rendered morally necessary by an offence which voids the guilt and cancels the offence.
3. Mu'zalite school: Theory of moral necessity, guilt subsists ony while unpunished. Appears subjectivist which makes the theory appear similar to asharite school of thought. However, because guilt is objective, then is a mu'zalite metaphysic of morals one where guilt = objective. So, morality objective? Can guilt be universal while morality is subjective?
4. But absolute guilt cannot be purged.
5. In Punishment, act which qualifies is unjust and rests on human initiative. In trial, compensation which makes God's action just awaits in the future and depends on God's spontaneous initiative. [from fn 43]

### 3 Alternatives to rejection of divine justice

1. Job's position (oppression is not unjust in God)
2. Compainions (Job is guilty)
3. Elihu (God will recompence):
	1. However, from discussion on 2019-02-06, recompense is not exactly correct. There is something greater which Job receives and this is expressed in the end of verse 6. Essentially, Job coming to know God is different than recompense that he received as a result of his suffering. It is better.
4. [fn 31] Requital vs. Recompense in response to the suffering of children.
5. Divine Voluntarism: Moral must vs. causal, logical and fatalistic necessity.
6. On one reading, we could say that God tried Job in order to silence adversaries. However this would be wrong and incomplete.

### 3 types of Suffering

1. Property
2. Body
3. Soul

Soul is not a test but immolation (sacrifice) and what children and irrational animals receive. Recompense, (but not requital). However, Job experienced something different, he had an experience of God. This was more than recompense and requital. 

Volutary action but not choice. [fn 17] of chap 3. Children and evil.

Moral vs. Natural evil

Moral evil has human involvement while natural evil does not. However truly natural evil is rare. 

How do we justify earthquakes? Death of sinners and repentance of sinners? What about death of sinner to change in other? Intrumentalizes. However, we do not know what happens to dying sinner. Aquinas thinks that you can be scared into heaven. But how? 

* Philial fear - Fear of disappointing
* Servile - Fear of retribution or punishment

Can servile fear get you into heaven? Yes

Proof of strange language inconsistencies in Job look at p. 408. Saadia wrote first lexicon on Jewish language in Egypt.

Karaite school of Judaisim
Accetic
literalist
populist
rationalist

First authority to dispute karaism

Book: The Geonim of Babylonia and the shaping of medieval Jewish culture by Robert Brody

p. 154 The adversary is human rather than anything else. Looks at language differently than previous rabbinic commentators.
p. 156 Treatment of design, intent role of angels. 

How does Saadia introduce problems of theodicy? Kalam rationalist in Mu'zalite tradition, In appendix of Goodman book on Saadia looks at rhetorical figures. p. 173 - Skin vs skin and limb vs limb distinction: Rhetorical usage of Greco Roman notion of climax. 
Anthology of Karaites, karaite anthology by Leon Nemoy.

### Does Saadia side with Elihu?

p. 129

Future looking state as an explanation for Job's suffering - therefore recompense. But if payment, then no justice. Mahmonides understands it as an issue of compensation. But the verb recant/relent has a direct object which is lacking. Recant/retract.

Saadia - there is a possibility of justified suffering for future benefit but does not equate to recompensation.

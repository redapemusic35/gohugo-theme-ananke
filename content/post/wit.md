# Excess and Deficiency

To be Witty (eutrapeloi) is the pinnacle of the social virtues. These are the virtues which enable community and social life. Both are very important in Aristtotle's Ethics.

It appears that the aspect of character that is highlighted by someone's use of wit is their intellectual faculties. However, Aristotle says that "things of this sort seem to be movements of people's characters." This impllies that wit is an important manistation of someone's character and not their intellectual capacity.

# Relaxation and Amusement are Neccessary in Life

It is not immediately clear why relaxation and amusement are necessary. However, Aristotle thinks that these are. It might have something to do with the importance of social interactions, and the social life.

It seems that wit is useful in not only navigating one's social environment, but also useful in being able to map it as well. I think that this last point is true because what someone thinks humerous, belies, I think, not only their social standing, but their education as well.

It is through someone's use of wit, that one should be able to determine whether or not they are a sophisticated person, and it is by those things which someone finds humorous that one would be able to determine whether they are slavish as opposed to free.

It seems then that the reason why wit is a virtue, is because of the usefulness it has in social environments, and the importance social environments hold for Aristotle. In a way then, wit, does not concern relaxation and amusement, but rather a form of work, one in which work is disguised as relaxation and amusement.

# Social Interaction

I wonder what Socrates thinks about "climbing the corporate [or social] ladder. On the one hand, I can imagine someone who places themselves in the right social contexts for the purposes of increasing their stature in life. They might endeavor to increase their understanding of what individuals of a certain sort find humorous for the purposes of appearing as though they share a similar education.

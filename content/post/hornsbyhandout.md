# Summary

1. According to Velleman, we are an agent in so far that we have the capacity to manifest agency par excellence:
  1. This is the inclusion of some additional mental state which is supposed to address the mind-body problem.
  2. However, one cannot address the mind-body problem by giving accounts of mind.
2. Hornsby suggests that in considering the capacity of an agent to act, we then avoid problems wherein the agent fails to account for her intentions in her actions.:
  1. Agency occurs in degrees.
  2. Furthermore, because the agent is able to express sorrow that her intentions are not made manifest, there is still an agent though her intention is not made manifest in her actions.

The question as it has been is "where do we find an agent at work amid the workings of the mind? (velleman, 1992 p. 131) The problem arises given a naturalistic conception of explanation derived from the casual story of action which argues that belief-desire causes behavior. Hornsby thinks that instead of trying to find the agent within the mind, the agent should instead be found 'in the world'.

## 2

a. According to Velleman, agents who are alienated are those who lack self-control, self-understanding, or undertake projects half-heartedly. For instance, "addicts who inject heroin in spite of knowing that it would be better if she could resist doing so." [@horn04aaaa, p. 173]

b. Velleman argues that it is belief-desire pairs which have caused this behavior and further, that these examples support the standard causal story. The problem is that these examples fail to show the relationship between the agent and her actions.

c. According to Velleman, the way we solve the above problem of agency within the standard story, is by adding something to the standard story's states and events. Velleman wants to add an additional mental state.

d. However, if we discard the standard story, Velleman's problem of agency vanishes. As such, the standard causal story should be rejected and not embellished by adding additional mental states.

a. Velleman adopts Nagel's picture of the world wherein 'all events and states of affairs are seen as caused either by other events and states or by nothing at all.' [@horn04aaaa, p. 174

b. But this presents a problem in that in order to adopt Nagel's view, we have to view actions as set apart from the agents of said action.

c. Nagelian view of agency: 

"Action is an event wherein an agent is doing the thing which is the agency. But this causes fear of alienation. Upon imagining one's actions are a part of the larger picture, our actions seem merely to be additional events and as such, we, under such a picture, we find ourselves alienated from the actions. It becomes difficult to see where agency is a part of the overall picture. However, if we do view actions as events, which both Nagel and naturalists believe them to be, then they are not merely events that are separate from agents. 

> "Thus, one might say: there are human beings who do things; when someone's doing something is her doing something or other intentionally, human agency is exemplified, and an event that is here doing the thing is an action." @horn04aaaa, p. 174

Essentially, where ever there is an action, there is an agent.

> "One might for instance know that some human being had caused something without knowing who had. Such examples, however, do nothing to suggest that one ought to look for a human being within the flux of events present in the picture from Nagel's external perspective." [@horn04aaaa, p. 174]

But this view presupposes that human agency is synonymous to human agency as a casual event or one in which we are necessarily 'doing' something only in the instance where the agent is not involved. This view only allows agents to intervene in affairs which they might never have been involved. Finally, the way out is to stop thinking of ourselves only as standing in relation to a world in which we only do or cause events that are our actions.

What is presupposed in such a view, is that the only way one can see themselves as an agent is either in a world in which there are actions without human agents, or that the only way to make a difference is by interrupting a series of events and states which the agent might not ever have been involved.

However, Hornsby believes that Nagel was right in that agents are evident in the world as human agents: 

> "the role of agents in a world of events is evident only when it is appreciated that agents cause things." [@horn04aaaa, p. 175]

a. While the problem of agency can be reproduced when viewing from afar, the same problem occurs when one looks at the inner workings of the mind.

b. Hornsby argues that Hume characterized this problem as one wherein our only powers are those of volition wherein the volition, being at a distance removed from the "limbs are not in a position to move the limbs directly." [@horn04aaaa, p. 177] While one might attribute Hume's concern to a non-understanding of contemporary science, using contemporary science, we can recreate similar skeptical scenarios. In part, the problem occurs when a causal picture similar to one in which Hume holds, is held. This picture views events which happen in the brain as only being those of event cause and effect relationships, such as would occur between operations of the brain and the movements of the agent's muscles. As such, it is purported to leave no room for human agency.

## 5

However, this might be too strong of a condition. A part of the problem, is that while we might recognize two events in the raising of a person's arm for instance---the event of the agent trying to raise her arm and the event of her arm rising---these are only the beginning of the theory. It necessitates a third condition, which will be the agent raising her arm intentionally, or rather the intentions of the agent. However, the third condition raises issues which lead to counter examples, for instance, the intervention of evil scientists in that the agent's intentions can be bypassed, leaving the causal efficacy of the action, but without the intention of the agent being manifest. 

A better view, argues Hornsby, is one which considers the agent's capacity to will the raising of her arm in the event that her arm is raised.

## 6

The standard story does not conflict, says Hornsby, with her story which characterizes action as an event of someone doing something intentionally. However, what happens is that naturalists convert the standard story into the standard causal story. They do this in three steps:

1. Desire and belief is translated into talk of items with causal potential. Reason is thought to be causal for a pair of states. 
2. Because these states are used in a casual explanation of why the agent acts, it is believed by naturalists that this surmounts to the states as being the cause of the action. 
3. An action is thought of something on the physical side of the 'mental/physical' divide and therefore called a bodily movement. The claim then, of the standard story of action, is that belief-desire pairs cause bodily movements. When attempts are taken into consideration, it is said that 'belief-desire pairs cause 'tryings' which cause movement. By relying on items linked in a causal chain, the standard story treats causation in the same way that Hume did, as states and events, and makes it possible that the agent is not involved.

## 7

Hornsby argues that Velleman distinguishes between agents who lack self-control (among other similarly debilitated agents) and what he calls agents par excellence. As such, Velleman would think of Nagel's view as containing the truth at least some of the time. However, how might Velleman think that Nagel's view reveals the obstacle to reconciling his view of agency with current scientific understanding? As Hornsby notes, Nagel does not think that there is any room for agency in a naturalistic explanatory order.

Part of the answer to this question is that Velleman thinks that there is agency whenever there is human action. But this relies on an assumption that Velleman makes in that we can see agency whenever it makes sense to say "he does it." But it cannot be said that Velleman can hold both that: 

> "Nagel's external perspective poses some genuine threat to our agency and 

> that someone's action is unproblematically accommodated in the naturalistic explanatory order by virtue of his having 'done it'". [@horn04aaaa, p. 180]

Velleman's account runs into the mind-body problem which he noted in Hume's account. He attempts to avoid the problem by introducing a further mental state; one in which the functional role of the agent is said to be operative. However, Hornsby does not think that this view avoids the mind-body problem. One cannot avoid the mind-body problem by introducing additional mental states.

## 8

Velleman thinks that his account avoids the mind body problem because agents who run into the problem of exercising volition, those without 'agency par excellence' are said to not have the sort of agency that we are looking for. However, even those agents whom Velleman would not attribute agency par excellence to, will express regret upon not being able to exercise her agency. As such, there is still an agent at the middle of actions which are said not to fully involve that agent's intentions. The operative word being 'fully'. Hornsby thus to suggest that agency comes in degrees, but that agency in degree is not less than agency. It is still agency.

We are an agent then so far in that we have the capacity to manifest agency par excellence(?)

## 9

Finally, Hornsby's account will also be able to incorporate accounts which distinguish between reasons, and accounts of character which take into consideration dispositions of evaluation, patterns of emotional reaction, global commitments and so forth.

Does this mean that her account makes room for traditional notions of the will then?

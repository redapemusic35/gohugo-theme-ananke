# What are the core features of Human Agency?

1. We can reflect on our motivations
2. We form prior plans and policies that organize our activity over time:
  1. Policy making is what it means to take the role of the agent. It is the sort of thing that does the thing that we want agents to do, or rather that we think that agents do
3. We see ourselves as agents who persist over time and who begin, develop, and then complete temporally extended activities and projects.

Our :diachonic: nature. This is our nature as it extends across time.

How do we reconcile these features of human agency within a event causal order narrative?

# Reflective Endorsement

Human beings have to capacity to not only be moved by their desires, but we also have the capacity to reflect on these desires. The reflection is often connected our assessments of our desires. These assessments "shape our deliberation, motivation and conduct."

When an agent has a first order desire; a second order desire that involves endorsing or not the first order desire, the second order desire manifests one aspect for one's capacity for reflection. The endorsing of one's first order desires does not happen merely through one's capacity for reflection on the first order because it appears to only be one more form of desire. It does not "manifest my capacity for a kind of endorsement or rejection of my first-order desire". One is merely choosing to side with either the one or the other desire.

:Weak_reflectiveness: is the capacity to have higher-order pro or con attitudes regarding first order desires. :Strong_reflectiveness: is determining where one stands with respect to a given first-order desire. But, merely choosing between desires does not amount to providing an explanation as to the cause of some event. Therefore there does not seem to be a human agency causal explanation to event causation.

While weak agency is not problematic, strong agency is. Strong agency seems to be the thesis that we possess pro and con attitudes which enable us to either endorse or not first order desires.

However, where does :strong_reflective: endorsement reside? Once you have :weak_reflective: endorsement, or :weak_reflectiveness: , it does not seem that you need :strong_reflectiveness:

However, given :weak_reflectiveness: you do not yet have an account of the agent. This is because it is the higher order policy, the :strong_reflectiveness: which highlights the agent. This is because once you have :strong_reflectiveness: you have an account of second order desires which highlights the place of the agent(?) This is because being an agent means having a capacity for policy making.

Not that it conflicts with our higher order policies, nor that they will not conflict, but rather whether you can have higher order policies with which we endorse, that we never act on.

This can occur in two ways:
1. Never have the chance to act on them.
2. 

What is it to be satisfied with a policy? One thing that should be considered is whether any of the higher order desires conflict. This might highlight some dissatisfaction with one's policies. However, Bratman does not thing this is the case. Rather we need to consider the relationship between higher order policies in that one's higher order policy does not conflict with others.

According to Kathryn Lindeman, a policy that only is it not the case that it does not conflict, but rather in cases of conflict, the policy that one endorses wins. In other words, what does it mean to have a higher order policy that one is satisfied with? One's that you are not satisfied with are one's that happen to be floating around in your psychic stew which might be attributed to some action that you committed. The conflict occurs when you have two higher order policies which conflict if acted on at the same time. But it is okay having these conflicting higher order policies. It's one thing to have two conflicting policies, this is okay. You may still be the agent. But to have a policy which undermines the other, pushes it out, if you act on the one that is being replaced, then the account of the agent is hidden

But, Bratman asks, "How do we get from the fact that certain *attitudes* favor a form of motivation to the fact that the *agent* endorses that motivation?"

> "One problem is that it is difficult to know what it means to say that the agent, as distinct from relevant psychological events, processes, and states, plays such a basic role in the etiology and explanation of action. Second, and relatedly, in seeing the agent as a fundamentally separate and distinct element in the metaphysics of our action we seem to abandon the idea that our agency is as fully embedded in the event causal order as is the agency of purposive agents like dogs and cats."

In order to keep strong reflection, we give up either being able to point to human agency as a causal explanation, or the idea that what explains action, has authority to ensure the agent's endorsement(?)

* Talk of the agent's strong endorsement of a desire points to a potential *explanation* of action, of why the agent acts as she does.
* Explanations of occurrences normally appeal to other occurrences, states, events, processes.
* This is why appeals to the agent as cause seem problematic when offered as explanations.
* But when we make appeals to other occurrences we risk giving up that what explains action has the authority to ensure the agent's endorsement.
* What ensures the agent's endorsement needs to have explanatory power and authority.
* Therefore we need to explain how this is possible.

* Bratman seems to use "planning agency" as the next step in an understanding of human agency. "We do not simply act from moment to moment. Instead, we settle on complex---and, typically, partial and hierarchically structured future plans of action." 

These play basic roles in support of the organization or coordination of our activities over time.

Plans concern specific courses of action extended over time such as 'always' buckling one's seatbelt, or stopping at red lights.

As such, Bratman believes that strong reflection and planning, while seemingly different aspects of our human agency, believes that they are more closely connected owing to the fact that we see ourselves as the same agent who acts in the past as well as the future.

There are several ways in which we can understand how identity over extended periods of time should be understood:

Locke and contemporary Lockeans understands identity as overlapping strands of various "psychological ties". But another way to think of a psychological tie, is as a kind of connectedness.

However Bratman does not think that this is the best understanding because when we think of beliefs that are temporally extended, often times we think of intentions as referencing prior, or future intentions. Further, these do not need to be present in the mere continuity of a desire. What Bratman means, is that while we might have a continuous desire, say of our flight being on time, the desire that my flight be on time today might not be for the same reason as my desire for my flight being on time 2 weeks from now while at the air port.

Bratman argues that we need some way to monitor our motivational structures over time. Doing so will allow us to understand an agent's identity over time. Locke believes that those features which do help us to understand identity in this way, will also help us to understand which attitudes are relevant in reflective endorsement.

Given our motivational structures, normally we are aware of our desires as being reasons for our motivation. However, there are cases in which either a desire motivates in the negative sense, or when a desire motivates absent our knowledge of it doing so.

* We then would not want to merely to treat a desire as a setting a justifying end in deliberation without also endorsing the desire's corresponding functioning as a motive. Nor would we want to merely endorse a desire's functioning as a motive.

Bratman proposes the following:

> "It seems to me, then, that we should understand an agent's endorsement of a desire in terms, roughly, of a self-governing policy in favor of the agent's treatment of that desire as providing a justifying reason in motivationally efficacious practical reasoning."

The self-governing policies which Bratman references, are proposed to have a special relation to our extended agency. However, there is not any reason to think that only the self-governing policies have this relation. There appears to be other attitudes (could be something else in addition to attitudes) that have this relation. Bratman therefore gives a more general account of satisfaction with self-governing policies. He says that to the endorsement of the agent is ensured by self-governing policies, or quasi policies with which the agent is satisfied.

# Questions

Q: When determining a good theory of agency, what is it that we are looking for?

A: We seem to be looking for aspects of one's psychology which seem to be compatible with those aspects of action that we attribute to agents.

1. Do questions about agency depend on various metaphysical assumptions:
  1. 

2. What warrant does Bratman have for presupposing the :Lockean_view: of identity?:
  1. The :Lockean_view: of identity is that the identity of persons persist over time.
  2. There are objections which highlight the problem of gaps in various psychological features such as memory and so forth.
3. But Bratman can be interpreted as addressing some of the objections to the :Lockean_view:
  1. Agency could be understood as persisting throughout time in that gaps in for say, memory could be filled in by appeals to intention for instance.
4.

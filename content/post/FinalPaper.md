# Notes

## Whose Justice, which Rationality?

## 2019-03-10

* Alisdair MacIntyre

* Our conceptions of justice change almost as in a paradigm. So that when we talk about the use of reason as in to derive principles such as those contributing to a particular conception of justice, our use of 'reason' also changes which contexts and paradigm.

As such, it is difficult to look back at past conceptions of justice without misunderstanding the use in which the terms describing it was used. 

:Justice: derives from the Homeric word, :dikaios: which means - to conduct ones actions ad affairs in accordance with [the single order of the universe]. 

:dike: = :judgment:

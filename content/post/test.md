What we are beginning to do today is probably one of the most central and important aspects of philosophical study. Until now, we have merely made arguments the way we probably always have. We have thought of reasons that until now, how sounded good and fine to us, and then we have defended those reasons based on other more additional reasons that have sounded good and fine to us. Sometimes the person with the most reasons wins the argument. Sometimes the person or persons with the most good and fine reasons wins the argument. And sometimes the person or persons with the most reasons that sound good and fine to us is the person who wins the argument. 

However, we have probably never really thought about why someone's reasons, or our own for that matter, have sounded good and fine to us. Previously, and maybe you have done this and maybe you haven't, but the argument used to be that; the reason why an argument sounds good and fine to you is because it is one that your parents taught you, neighbor, grand parents, pastor, teacher etc. Consider religious arguments:

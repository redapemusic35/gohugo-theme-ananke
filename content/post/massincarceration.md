# Eric Miller - Harms of race based policing

We should avoid morally problematic social roles. 

Race based policing harms the community. Role based discipline, victimhood. 

Standing up for oneself with equal political footing. What does this mean? I missed the first part of what was said. Many times what is pointed out as problematic in the relations between minority's and majority communities, is that the actions of the majority community members are morally reprehensible. However, why is it always only the actions of the majority community members are criticized? There should be prudential considerations which also are made. Yet there is a third position that one can take as well. This third position begins from the point of view that those whose actions are reprehensible, but to consider the cost as one owing from a problem wherein all humanity is sinful in nature. The question becomes whether 


# The talk

Members of minority communities must behave in a way that is distinct from the members of majority community. 

Rather, the question becomes whether or not acting in a way that is distinct is reprehensible. Do we have a duty to resist the demands of an officer? Are we required to assert our humanity? In the moment? If we are required to assert our humanity and resist the demands of a rabid dog, then we are required to also assert our humanity in these situations with police. However we are not required to assert our humanity when faced with a rabid dog. Therefore we are not required to assert to humanity with an unreasonable stop. 

We are being denied our social and political roles given improper relationships between police and citizens. 

Many talks such as this begin from the position that white supremacists operate from a position of power. However, what kind of power are we talking about. It implies that they have the power to incorporate others into their societies or exclude them. However, given that so many agree that their communities have so many problematic relationships between themselves and others, then the only power they have is the power that is given to them. But this can be taken away from them by declining to join their communities. Granted, when talking about colonialism or similar practices, we might argue that there is a third way in which a colonizer has power. However, I wonder if we can take a cue from Jewish communities in the diaspora. Essentially the minority communities become more desirable than membership in the majority community. Interactions between the majority and minority's community's are kept to a minimum but not on the part of the colonizer but on the part of the minority's community. The minority's community seeks to keep their interactions with the majority's to a minimum because it is believed that the majority's is inferior to the minority's.

### Harm Reduction in Criminal Justice 

Philosophy of punishment, the challenge is understanding what makes sense

Retributive theory is easily subjected  to harm. Further the retributive theory is dependent on the view that the agent is capable of doing other than those actions that they committed. 

Do agents have a choice?

To say that a person could have acted well, or better requires that they are able to do other than what was done. However, to say that they were not able implies that they are unable to better than what they did. 

One argument that they could not depends on whether or not they are psychologically healthy. 

### Case of Eric Clark

McNaughton defense. Was not applicable. 

M'Naghten Insanity Defense

M'Naghten's Case, House of Lords 10 Cl. & F. 200, 8 End. Rep 718 (1843)

The defendant must establish that "at the time of committing the act, he was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong."

Retributivist are wrong because given that members of a certain community have greater inability for moral behavior and therefore they should be held to a different standard. 

> Because the political power of the disadvantaged is weaker, their legal obligations are correspondingly weaker. 

> thus they are less blameworthy for violating the law. 

> Thus they are less deserving of punishment 

> criminal guilt does not imply moral guilt, nor does it justify moral blame

The retributive theory should be rejected in exchange for a view of harm reduction. 

I have a question about moral desert. The argument is that there is no moral desert to adhere to the policies set by the society due to being unable to or disadvantaged from doing so. However, what sense of moral is at play here? For instance, regardless of my position in a society, I might teach my children that because of human sin, my position makes me obligated in ways in which others are not. I might tell my child that they must work harder than their classmates. Further, I might tell them that their hard work is a reward in itself regardless of the outcome. Further, suffering might then become a cause for celebration as reward for hard work. 


Because someone is not party to some commitment, they do not have an obligation to that commitment.

### Questions

1. How do we measure the harm reduction method? Prioritize mental over physical harm? What about outside the prison system? The supervisor system is culpable in that it takes advantage of those within it. 

2. What about majority minority's communities? Does not appear to be an answer. Nothing satisfying. 

3. It seems that rehabilitation should focus on restoring rationality. Does the harm reduction model support this idea?

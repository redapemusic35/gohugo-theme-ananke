### Book IV of NE

What does it mean to be :practical: ? This will be the subject of interest in book IV. (I think) What is :practical: is that which are good in themselves. For instance the good of a city, is more complete, good in itself. We must use a method of inquiry that is pertinent to the subject at hand. (Bk I, ch. 3, :1094b25: )

What is the difference between a mock virtue and a quasi-virtue? 

What is the difference between Augustinian virtue, Aristotelian virtue and Aquinian virtues? This might be the beginning to the question of the difference between mock and quasi-virtues. Look at ( :1116b1: ) the type of courage that is not real, because it is not depending on knowledge of the situation at hand. This highlights a distinction between mock and real virtue. The real virtue has to do with choice whereas we can see how the mock virtue is not in accordance with choice. 

Bk 5, virtue of justice understood as lawfulness. 

##  Date Unknown

:Genus: :Species: 

:Praxis: Practical activity
:Dunamus: Capacity
:Pathos: Feelings, passions
:hexis: State, Disposition
:Diathesis: state, disposition (sometimes a physical state)
:Arete: character

What is the connection between feeling, activity, desire and perception?

1. First, excellence of virtue is not an activity, or state, but a apacity and something else(?)
2. How do passions differ from habits, states... This should be self explanatory given the above.
3. Emotional states allow one to more effectively teach to the emotional student.
4. Genus is hexis of virtue:
  1. Where :virtue: is a medial state in relation to us defined by a wise person. [this will be explored much later, but is important]

  1. Shame vs. Fear, shame is not a virtue but a feeling[?]
  2. Medial person's have sense of shame, this helps them to learn.
  3. Should only be shamed at having done [base] actions[?]
  4. One who fears disrepute is noble. 

### Book 4, ch. 7

1. The [Ironist] is the person who represents things as something other than they are, normally as something less than what it is.
2. The person who lives [ironically] is a person who represents themselves as being less than they are in actuality.:
  1. Is [Jesus] an [ironist]?:
    1. Though Jesus is the obvious [Great Souled Person], He represents Himself as other than what He is.
    2. As such, it appears that Jesus is not explicitly truthful.
  2. Truthfulness involves the presentation of one's self as they truly are.
  3. Is Jesus fully disclosing Himself as He truly is?:
    1. The road to irraneous, at the well with the woman,
    2. These were tools that He used
  4. Look at page 67.:
    1. [Great Souled Person] always tells the truth accept when he is being [ironic] in the presence of those incapable of perceiving.

### Chapter 6

1. Subjective vs. objective goods. Aristotle's account does not account for personal good:
	1. Cristism of plate
2. Argument in ch. 6:
	1. Different and varying conceptions of the good
	2. So no 'form'.
	3. substance, quality, relation, quantity
	4. If there was a form of the good, there wuold not be so many discrepancies.

3. Questions:
	1. Can any one ever be called happy
	2. Yes,
	3. But they could just as easily lose it all because it takes a whole life
4. Read metaphysics Bk 9, chap 6

5. Difference between kinesis and energeia
What about Plato's recursive knowledge. One did not have to learn anything, but merely recall.

Activity vs Motion

Motion is completed when motion stops
Activity is never completed

Quality of fundtion

## Aristotle Notes

### 1/22/19  NE - Book I chapter 4

Every source of knowledge and every deliberate choice seeks after some good. 
The good after which everyone seeks is happiness, although what specifically this is, or whether it can be truly known depends on one's status. Aristotle here makes a distinction between ordinary people and ... .

####  Ordinary People

*
:Test:

According to Reeve, ordinary people 

[hoi polloi]

which translates as the many or the multitude. Refers to "a majority of people of whatever sort". Used in Aristotle's context somewhat perjoritively however.

#### Intrinsically  Note 30

* 
:kath-hauto:

or 

:auto kath:

:all by itself. Or in it's own right, unconditionally, what it itself essentially is.

# Aquinas

## Religion and Being 

1. We should revise esse or our understanding of esse

## Aquinas's esse: basic

1. Classic ciriticim Aquinas does not know of 1st order predicate logic
2. Esse as actuality: basic meaning
3. differences from the actuality of modal logic
4. "mode" interpretation of essence
5. esse as particular

### Aquinas's esse: Basics

:esse: to be, to exist
:ens: a being, an existent, an existing object
:existence: what it means to be :ens: (?)

1. Aquinas's central thesis:
	1. God is its own :esse:
2. Positive evaluation:
3. Negative evaluation:
	1. sophistry and illusion
	2. existence is not a predicate:
		1. enrichment by language
		2. but not semantics we are talking about syntax
	3. existence is same as number:
		1. extensional
		2. so not empty:
			1. if 1st level etc
		3. if 1st, then still meaningful
		4. so not not empty (Geach)
	4. Being is some kind of actuality, and :Aquinas: says that being is
	   actuality (like a trope)

4. being:
	1. esse
	2. essense:
		1. form
		2. matter

5. What is the actuality the second composition?
6. The first actuality:
	1. actuality of forms
	2. consitituted of in-world properties
7. second:
	1. actuality of esse
	2. given to this world from outside
8. What is the second? This is more important than the first
9. 4 common and different points between esse and modal logic:
	1. esse:
		1. esse and essence is different
	2. modal logic:
		1. actuality is not any property in the world
10. Strong points:
	1. ml not 1st order or what existential quantifier expresses either:
		1. real
		2. conceptual
	2. so a distinction between actuality and form
11. Difference metaphysically important:
	1. esse:
		1. being depends of free will of god
		2. God might not have created
	2. ml actuality
12. But esse has additional differences:
	1. perfections
	2. particularity
	3. non-accidental connection
13. esse is non-accidental properties
14. Requirements of esse:
	1. esse has every perfection
	2. objects have own esse
15. esse is a function to actualize essence
16. but rather, essence is a restricting function operating on esse:
	1. butter
	2. water drops
17. Problems of mode interpretation:
	1. essence determine esse which is infinite?
	2. God and creation is the same
	3. metaphysically unacceptable:
		1. esse is verb, so restriction is like adverbial so either:
			1. is like pantheism
			2. so univocal understanding of being
		2. neither are any good
18. what about belonging to particular actuality (?):
	1. (a + *bi*)(a - *bi*) = $a^{2}$ + $b^{2}$:
		1. a
		2. b
		3. c non accidental
		4. but why does esse have every perfection but not essence?:
			1. add hocish
			2. not clear why esse perfection but not essence
		5. so no (?)
	2. Strong points of each interpretation:
		1. ml:
			1. esse essence distinction
		2. mode:
			1. essence almost nothing
		3. trope:
			1. too dualistic for esse to be constructied by
			   essential principles
		4. each equally strong and weak (?)
		5. restricted to created world
		6. does not help to understand divine esse
		7. aquinas try to explain divine
19. New start:
	1. mode leads to pantheism
	2. ml and trop to dualism
20. esse as non-actualizer:
	1. difference between 1st and 2nd actuality:
		1. 1st in-world change:
			1. matter is actualized by form
		2. 2nd is not in-wold but related to creation:
			1. not to creation
		3. esse actualizes things:
			1. ultimate actuality
			2. actuality of all things
		4. What is actual?
	2. Where there is action, there is a singular object:
		1. primary substance
		2. etc. (?)
	3. Reconstructing of the understanding:
		1. particular things already working
		2. not actualized by esse
		3. working pwer is not a limitation of infinite power but an
		   expression of infinite creative power
		4. stop imagining how God created from esse
	4. stop imagining how God created from esse:
		1. esse is not a component but a result or an achievemnet
		2. when something
21. esse is like value:
	1. the metaphysical relation of essence to esse is like adding some
	   kind of value:
	2. every perfection is included in vlaue
	3. each particular object has its own value
	4. the value of something is constituted from principles

In the case of mechanistic, the movement under consideration is not under the       -guidance of the agent.                                                                 2
## V. 

However, even though our actions of atates and events depend upon the exercise   -of our higher capacities, we should not exaggerate the peculiarity of what human       -beings do. This is because we are not unique in either the purposiveness of our        -behavior or its intentionality.                                                        2
-## In intentional purposive movement, the guidance is provided by the agent.

However, consider that the driver of an automobile might have guidance of a movement, such as her car, even though when coasting, she might not have her hand on   -the steering wheel or the gas pedal.

## What this example shows us is that our intentional purposive movement is not the    -effect of something we do, but something that we have capacity to do.

## Consider that a person acts freely only in that he could have acted otherwise.      -[principle of alternate possibilities]                                                 2                                                                              Consider that of a heroin addict who takes the drug because they enjoy it. Assumig  -that he tried to do otherwise, not take the drug, he would then be led to take the     -drug given his addiction though now it would appear that he takes it freely.           2                                                                              ## Davidson argues that a person cannot intentionally do what alien forces cause him   -to do.
## However, 

Davidson makes a distinction between action and behavior. [the issue here  -is not, as Davidson suggests at one point, whether a person’s action can be            -intentional when alien forces rather than his own attitudes account for what he does.  -It is whether his behvaior can be intentional in those circumstances.]                 2                                                                                       [The relevant problem is not whether an action can occur apart form attitudinal     -conditionas. It is whether it is possible that an action should be caused by alien     -forces alone.]

This is because it is not necessary that an action have an           -antecedent causal history of any particular kind.

Though saying that someone has performed an action entails that a movement certain  -movements occurred under that individual’s guidance, this is not the same thing as     -saying that individual was able to [keep himself from guiding his movements as he did.]

A prominent and increasingly more so objection to Christian faith holds that, more generally, religious belief is the result of cognitive capacities functioning in ways above and beyond their effectiveness. More pointedly, Christian faith is caused by such cogntive faculties in that they persist because the other functions that these faculties perform are *so* effective that the facilitation of false beliefs do not diminish their adaptive utility. Or that the false beliefs themselves have contributed enough to the creatures' survival that they continue to persist all though the objects of focus for these capacities are empty.

There are many more versions of this argument and it will not be prudent for me to attempt to present them all on this one landing page. The primary focus of this blog will be Alvin Plantinga's evolutionary argument against naturalism. The reason that I chose this specific focus is because to me, Plantinga's argument is very similar to the aforementioned one. There is one specifically stark difference however, namely that Plantinga defends the argument by showing that the converse is true, that religious beliefs actually help to guard our cognitive faculties against the evolutionary threat. We must protect our cognitive faculties at all costs against that very real threat known as evolutionary reliabilism!
